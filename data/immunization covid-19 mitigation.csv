Routine childhood immunization may be adversely affected by COVID-19 mitigation measures. We aimed to identify the prevalence of delayed immunization and explore the reasons and barriers for delayed immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online self-administered questionnaire for parents of children under two years of age during the period from 1 May to 30 June 2020. Most of the 749 participants (82.6%) were mothers, with 31 to 40 years being the most common age group (49.8%). Nearly three-quarters (73.2%) of the parents had appointments scheduled for their child's vaccination during the pandemic, and approximately 23.4% of the parents reported a delay of more than one month in the immunization of their child. The most common reason for the delay was the fear of being infected by COVID-19 (60.9%). Large household size and lack of insurance were risk factors for immunization delay. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the timeliness of routine childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia. Childhood immunization should be prioritized, as well as the implementation of focused strategies to achieve significant and sustainable vaccination rates during pandemics.",,,,,,", Aqeel/0000-0003-1681-5338; Alsuhaibani, Mohammed/0000-0003-3181-777X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-393X,,,,DEC,2020,8,4,,,,,,,581,10.3390/vaccines8040581,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040581,,,,,,,,33022916,,,,,WOS:000601791200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Vaccination is an effective measure against COVID-19 infections. In Malaysia amidst the national immunisation programme (NIP) which started in February 2021, there were rising concerns regarding the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, and therefore, vaccine uptake among Malaysians. Although there are many quantitative studies on COVID-19 vaccination, the subjective experience of individuals was understudied. This study aims to explore the lived experiences of Malaysians regarding vaccine hesitancy and refusal, and facilitating factors that could enhance vaccine acceptance and uptake. Methods This qualitative study employed the hermeneutic phenomenological study design. Purposive sampling strategies were used to recruit Malaysians that had direct experiences with friends, family members and their community who were hesitating or refusing to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. A semi-structured interview guide was developed based on the expert knowledge of the investigators and existing literature on the topic. A series of focus group interviews (FGIs) was conducted online facilitated by a multidisciplinary team of experts. The group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed. Results Fifty-nine participants took part in seven FGIs. We found that incongruence was the overall thematic meaning that connected all the 3 main themes. These themes comprise firstly, the incongruence between the aims and implementation of the National Immunization Program which highlighted the gap between realities and needs on the ground. Secondly, the incongruence between Trust and Mistrust revealed a trust deficit in the government, COVID-19 news, and younger people's preference to follow the examples of local vaccination heroes. Thirdly, the incongruence in communication showed the populace's mixed views regarding official media and local social media. Conclusions This study provided rich details on the complex picture of the COVID-19 immunization program in Malaysia and its impact on vaccine hesitancy and refusal. The inter-related and incongruent factors explained the operational difficulty and complexity of the NIP and the design of an effective health communication campaign. Identified gaps such as logistical implementation and communication strategies should be noted by policymakers in implementing mitigation plans.",,,,,"Chan, Nn/AFM-2606-2022; Yacob, Shakila/B-9733-2010; Lee, Kai Wei/GXG-3329-2022; Chia, Yook-Chin/B-8379-2010","Yacob, Shakila/0000-0002-2998-0255; Lee, Kai Wei/0000-0001-9737-8066; Chia, Yook-Chin/0000-0003-1995-0359",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,FEB 14,2022,22,1,,,,,,,296,10.1186/s12889-022-12632-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12632-z,,,,,,,,35164734,,,,,WOS:000755134900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

M.",,,COVID-19 impact on routine immunisations for vaccine-preventable diseases: Projecting the effect of different routes to recovery,VACCINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Over the past two decades, vaccination programmes for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) have expanded across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the rise of COVID-19 resulted in global disruption to routine immunisation activities. Such disruptions could have a detrimental effect on public health, leading to more deaths from VPDs, particularly without mitigation efforts. Hence, as routine immunisation activities resume, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of different approaches for recovery. We apply an impact extrapolation method developed by the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium to estimate the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions with different recovery scenarios for ten VPDs across 112 LMICs. We focus on deaths averted due to routine immunisations occurring in the years 2020-2030 and investigate two recovery scenarios relative to a no-COVID-19 scenario. In the recovery scenarios, we assume a 10% COVID-19-related drop in routine immunisation coverage in the year 2020. We then linearly interpolate coverage to the year 2030 to investigate two routes to recovery, whereby the immunization agenda (IA2030) targets are reached by 2030 or fall short by 10%. We estimate that falling short of the IA2030 targets by 10% leads to 11.26% fewer fully vaccinated persons (FVPs) and 11.34% more deaths over the years 2020-2030 relative to the no-COVID-19 scenario, whereas, reaching the IA2030 targets reduces these proportions to 5% fewer FVPs and 5.22% more deaths. The impact of the disruption varies across the VPDs with diseases where coverage expands drastically in future years facing a smaller detrimental effect. Overall, our results show that drops in routine immunisation coverage could result in more deaths due to VPDs. As the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions is dependent on the vaccination coverage that is achieved over the coming years, the continued efforts of building up coverage and addressing gaps in immunity are vital in the road to recovery.

The simulator includes modules to support contact tracing of the interactions amongst individuals and epidemiological testing of the general population. The particles are distinguished by age to represent more accurately the infection and mortality rates. The tool can be calibrated by region of interest and for different vaccination strategies to enable locality-sensitive virus mitigation policy measures and resource allocation. Moreover, the vaccination policy can be simulated based on the prioritization of certain age groups or randomly vaccinating individuals across all age groups. The results based on the experience of the province of Lecco, Italy, indicate that the simulator can evaluate vaccination strategies in a way that incorporates local circumstances of viral propagation and demographic susceptibilities. Further, the simulator accounts for modeling the distinction between sterilizing immunization, where immunized people are no longer contagious, and effective immunization, where the individuals can transmit the virus even after getting immunized. The parametric simulation results showed that the sterilizing-age-based vaccination scenario results in the least number of deaths. Furthermore, it revealed that older people should be vaccinated first to decrease the overall mortality rate. Also, the results showed that as the vaccination rate increases, the mortality rate between the scenarios shrinks.",,,,,,"Kuzdeuov, Askat/0000-0001-6169-8252",,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-2194,2168-2208,,,,DEC,2021,25,12,,,,,4317,4327,,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3114180,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2021.3114180,,,,,,,,34546932,,,,,WOS:000728140900013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies have reported a near disappearance of respiratory pathogens including B. pertussis following implemen-tation of mitigation strategies to control Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We explored how immu-nity against B. pertussis changed in women of childbearing-age through the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: Paired blood samples from females of childbearing-age collected at the beginning (May-June 2020) and nearly one year into the COVID-19 pandemic (February-May 2021) in British Columbia (BC), Canada were tested for anti-B. pertussis IgG levels. To ascertain whether early-pandemic IgG levels in 2020 reflected levels in pregnant women early in gestation, 1st trimester sera collected from age-matched healthy pregnant women in 2018 and 2019 were tested for anti-B. pertussis IgG. Levels were compared by t tests. P-value of 0.05 was assigned and statistical significance was set as p < 0.016 using Bonferroni correction.Results: Annual provincial B. pertussis incidences per 100,000 in BC in 2020 (3/100,000) and 2021 (<1/100,000) approximated the lowest levels since 1990. In 2021 vs. 2020, anti-pertussis toxin (PT), fil-amentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) IgG levels declined in women of childbearing-age: 6.8 IU/ml (95 %CI, 4.2-10.9) vs. 8.4 IU/ml (5.1-13.9; p = 0.004); 18.8 IU/ml (10.9-32.2) vs. 23.6 IU/ml (13.2-42.1; p < 0.001); and 37.1 IU/ml (18.1-75.9) vs. 47.2 IU/ml (24.8-89.9; p = 0.092), respectively. Although all values were slightly higher, anti-PT, FHA and PRN IgG levels in women of childbearing age did not significantly differ in 2020 compared with early-gestation pregnant women in 2018-2019, 8.4 IU/ml (95% CI, 5.1-13.9) vs. 5.4 IU/ml (95% CI, 3.8-7.7; p = 0.166), 23.6 IU/ml (95% CI, 13.2-42.1) vs. 20.1 IU/ml (95% CI, 13.4-30.2; p = 0.656), and 47.2 IU/ml (24.8-89.9) vs. 17.3 IU/ml (95% CI, 10.5- 28.7; p = 0.021), respectively.Discussion: B. pertussis infections should be closely monitored during the relaxing of mitigation measures for COVID-19.

The direct effects of the pandemic, as well as the non-pharmacological interventions for its containment, mitigation and suppression adopted by many countries, have affected their vaccination programs. We conducted an ecological study analyzing the performance of the vaccination program in the Dominican Republic before (2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). We compared annual public coverage data, analyzed trends and changes in coverage, dropout rate, and number of partially and unvaccinated infants by geographic area and COVID-19 incidence rate. Compared to baseline, coverage for all vaccines decreased by 10.4 (SD, 3.6) percent; among these, coverage for the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine decreased from 90.1% in 2019 to 81.1% in 2020. The number of partially vaccinated (n = 34,185) and unvaccinated (n = 5,593) infants increased 66% and 376%, respectively. The slight increase in the annual dropout rate (1.1%) was directly proportional to the number of COVID-19 cases per month. We found a significant association between the annual absolute change of Penta3 and the subnational Human Development Index. The pandemic significantly weakened the performance of the routine vaccination program.

Despite this recommendation, willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine and its determinant factors among lactating mothers were not studied in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to assess willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine and its determinant factors among lactating mothers in Ethiopia. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was employed in southern Ethiopia from February 1 up to March 15, 2021. Multistage sampling technique was used to select study participants. Structured and face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were clean, coded, and entered into Epi-Data version 4.2.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 software package for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable analysis were used to identify associated factors. Adjusted odds ratio along with 95% CI was used to measure the strength of association. Results: The prevalence of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination was found to be 61% (95% CI; 56.9-65.1%).

To fill this evidence-gap and guide mitigation measures, we estimated the impact of COVID-19 disruptions on global BCG coverage and paediatric TB mortality. First, we used data from multiple sources to estimate COVID-19-disrupted BCG vaccination coverage. Second, using a static mathematical model, we estimated the number of additional paediatric TB deaths in the first 15 years of life due to delayed/missed vaccinations in 14 scenarios-varying in duration of disruption, and magnitude and timing of catch-up. We estimated a 25% reduction in global BCG coverage within the disruption period. The best-case scenario (3-month disruption, 100% catch-up within 3 months) resulted in an additional 886 (0.5%) paediatric TB deaths, and the worst-case scenario (6-month disruption with no catch-up) resulted in an additional 33,074 (17%) deaths. The magnitude of catch-up was found to be the most influential variable in minimising excess paediatric TB mortality. Our results show that ensuring catch-up vaccination of missed children is a critical priority, and delivery of BCG alongside other routine vaccines may be a feasible way to achieve catch-up.

We examined the characteristics of decedents with COVID-19-related mortality to help inform discussions about vaccination, boosters, and mitigation strategies. Methods: We examined COVID-19-related deaths in Kentucky resulting from infections occurring from July 1 through August 13, 2021. We used records from case investigations, medical records, the Kentucky Health Information Exchange, and the Kentucky Immunization Registry to determine demographic information, vaccination status, and underlying health conditions, including calculation of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). We calculated mortality incidence rates by vaccination status by using data for unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations in Kentucky as of July 1, 2021. Results: In total, 777 COVID-19-related deaths occurred in Kentucky during the study period; 592 (76.2%) occurred among unvaccinated people. Compared with unvaccinated decedents, fully vaccinated decedents were older (median age, 77 vs 65 years; P < .001), had higher comorbidity levels (median CCI, 3 vs 1; P < .001), and were more likely to have immunocompromised health status (26.4% vs 16.0%; P = .003). Diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and chronic lung disease were more common among vaccinated decedents than among unvaccinated decedents. Unvaccinated adults had a significantly higher risk of death than fully vaccinated adults (incidence rate ratio for age 20-49 years: 20.5 [95% CI, 6.5-64.8]; 50-64 years: 14.6 [95% CI, 9.4-22.7]; >= 65 years: 10.2 [95% CI, 8.3-12.4]). Conclusions: Immunocompromised health status, older age, and higher comorbidity were prevalent among fully vaccinated decedents, suggesting adults with these characteristics may benefit from additional protection strategies.

We evaluated VI, FAE, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptomatology, compliance with community mitigation strategies, food and economic insecurity, mental health evaluation and the influence in VI when recommended by different stakeholders. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95%CIs. Results: We analyzed 472,521 responses by Latin American adults, finding a VI and FAE prevalence of 80.0% and 81.2%, respectively. We found that female and non-binary genders were associated with a lower probability of VI and a higher probability of FAE. Besides, living in a town, village or rural area and economic insecurity was associated with a higher FAE probability. The fears of becoming seriously ill, a family member becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and having depressive symptoms were associated with a higher probability of VI and FAE.

Recent evidence suggests that this will cause additional maternal and childhood mortality and morbidity especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here we have explored the contextual factors influencing maternal, neonatal and children health (MNCH) care in Bangladesh, Nigeria and South Africa amidst the pandemic. Our findings suggest that between March and May 2020, there was a reduction in utilisation of basic essential MNCH services such as antenatal care, family planning and immunization due to: a) the implementation of lockdown which triggered fear of contracting the COVID-19 and deterred people from accessing basic MNCH care, and b) a shift of focus towards pandemic, causing the detriment to other health services, and c) resource constraints. Taken together these issues have resulted in compromised provision of basic general healthcare. Given the likelihood of recurrent waves of the pandemic globally, COVID-19 mitigation plans therefore should be integrated with standard care provision to enhance system resilience to cope with all health needs. This commentary suggests a four-point contextualised mitigation plan to safeguard MNCH care during the pandemic using the observed countries as exemplars for LMIC health system adaptations to maintain the trajectory of progress regarding sustainable development goals (SDGs).",,,,,"Rahman, Ahmed Ehsanur/ABC-5318-2021; Professor Dilly Anumba MBBS, FWACS/A-6358-2011","Professor Dilly Anumba MBBS, FWACS/0000-0003-2502-3033; Ahmed, Tanvir/0000-0001-8147-5136; Gillespie, Bronwen/0000-0003-1833-209X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1475-9276,,,,MAR 15,2021,20,1,,,,,,,77,10.1186/s12939-021-01414-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01414-5,,,,,,,,33722225,,,,,WOS:000629379700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many countries have postponed vaccination campaigns out of concern about infection risks to the staff delivering vaccination, the children being vaccinated, and their families. The World Health Organization recommends considering both the benefit of preventive campaigns and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when making decisions about campaigns during COVID-19 outbreaks, but there has been little quantification of the risks. Methods We modelled excess SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to vaccinators, vaccinees, and their caregivers resulting from vaccination campaigns delivered during a COVID-19 epidemic. Our model used population age structure and contact patterns from three exemplar countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Brazil). It combined an existing compartmental transmission model of an underlying COVID-19 epidemic with a Reed-Frost model of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to vaccinators and vaccinees. We explored how excess risk depends on key parameters governing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, and aspects of campaign delivery such as campaign duration, number of vaccinations, and effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and symptomatic screening. Results Infection risks differ considerably depending on the circumstances in which vaccination campaigns are conducted. A campaign conducted at the peak of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with high prevalence and without special infection mitigation measures could increase absolute infection risk by 32 to 45% for vaccinators and 0.3 to 0.5% for vaccinees and caregivers. However, these risks could be reduced to 3.6 to 5.3% and 0.1 to 0.2% respectively by use of PPE that reduces transmission by 90% (as might be achieved with N95 respirators or high-quality surgical masks) and symptomatic screening. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection risks to vaccinators, vaccinees, and caregivers during vaccination campaigns can be greatly reduced by adequate PPE, symptomatic screening, and appropriate campaign timing. Our results support the use of adequate risk mitigation measures for vaccination campaigns held during SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, rather than cancelling them entirely.",,,,,"Lei, Jiayao/AGW-9657-2022; Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022; Procter, Simon/AAK-9047-2020; Jarvis, Christopher/A-2969-2016","Procter, Simon/0000-0002-0380-1503; Medley, Graham/0000-0002-0030-7278; Waites, William/0000-0002-7759-6805; Villabona Arenas, Christian Julian/0000-0001-9928-3968; Hodgson, David/0000-0002-5585-8974; Liu, Yang/0000-0002-9368-0425; Bosse, Nikos I./0000-0002-7750-5280; Quaife, Matthew/0000-0001-9291-1511; Flasche, Stefan/0000-0002-5808-2606; Abbott, Sam/0000-0001-8057-8037; Abbas, Kaja/0000-0003-0563-1576; Jarvis, Christopher/0000-0002-0812-2446; McCarthy, Ciara/0000-0002-5185-2962; Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255; Quilty, Billy/0000-0002-9094-3728; Tully, Damien/0000-0002-7620-9340; Pung, Rachael/0000-0002-1188-8231",,,,,,,,,,,,,1741-7015,,,,,AUG 12,2021,19,1,,,,,,,198,10.1186/s12916-021-02072-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02072-8,,,,,,,,34384441,,,,,WOS:000685303100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful.

Methods Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from travellers to Madagascar, suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases and contact of confirmed cases. Swabs were tested at the national reference laboratory using real-time RT-PCR. Data collected from patients were entered in an electronic database for subsequent statistical analysis. All distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases were mapped, and six genomes of viruses were fully sequenced. Results Overall, 26,415 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 18 March and 18 September 2020, of whom 21.0% (5,553/26,145) returned positive. Among laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the median age was 39 years (IQR: 28-52), and 56.6% (3,311/5,553) were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. The probability of testing positive increased with age with the highest adjusted odds ratio of 2.2 [95% CI: 1.9-2.5] for individuals aged 49 years and more. Viral strains sequenced belong to clades 19A, 20A and 20B indicative of several independent introduction of viruses. Conclusions Our study describes the first wave of the COVID-19 in Madagascar.

While the search for a vaccine represents the hope to overcome the pandemic, measures were established to control the disease transmission through individual and collective actions of hygiene and physical distancing. Based on the popular clamor for new vaccines, this critical essay discusses the paradox and contradictions of the individual-society relationship in the context of COVID-19 considering vaccine hesitancy as a historical and social phenomenon. We also argue that decisions on (not) vaccinating or (not) following COVID-19 control and preventive measures are influenced by social belonging and traversed by inequalities that tend to exacerbate. COVID-19 surrounding infodemic and vaccine hesitancy reflect the tension between scientifically-validated and self-perceived risk, besides being impacted by the crisis of confidence in science.

J,"Hong, SA",,,,"Hong, Shin-Ae",,,COVID-19 vaccine communication and advocacy strategy: a social marketing campaign for increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake in South Korea,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Research evidence suggests that communication is a powerful tool for influencing public opinion and attitudes toward various health-related issues, such as vaccine reluctance, provided it is well-designed and thoughtfully conducted. In particular, social marketing techniques that alter the target audience's behaviors for the public good can substantially improve vaccine uptake if adopted as a communication strategy in immunization programs to counter public hesitancy. This study presents evidence from the Korean government's current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign, which successfully applied a social marketing approach. By the end of August 2022, South Korea had achieved high vaccine coverage, with 94.8% of the population (12+) receiving a second dose, 71.3% a third dose, and a fourth dose drive currently underway. There are five crucial factors to consider when preparing official communication for an immunization program: (i) a high degree of proactiveness, (ii) credibility, (iii) fighting misinformation, (iv) emphasizing social norms and prosocial behavior, and (v) coherence. Although using social marketing strategies may not be successful in all circumstances, the lessons learned and current implementation in Korea suggest their efficacy in fostering vaccine acceptance. This study offers valuable insights for government agencies and global public health practitioners to develop effective targeted campaign strategies that enhance the target population's vaccination intention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2662-9992,,,,MAR 16,2023,10,1,,,,,,,109,10.1057/s41599-023-01593-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01593-2,,,,,,,,36942012,,,,,WOS:000952322500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Chest CT Severity Score (CTSS) provides a semi quantitative assessment of pulmonary involvement in COVID19 patients. COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures such as SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are being deployed worldwide. However, with the emerging variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2, a high prevalence of post vaccination breakthrough infections is seen. Aim: To assess the association of CTSS with the vaccination status in a cohort of COVID-19 patients referred to a tertiary diagnostic centre and to evaluate the association of CTSS with other clinical parameters including co-morbidities in these patients. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a tertiary care diagnostic imaging centre in the city of Pune, Maharashtra, India. Data of 1002 symptomatic, adult patients who underwent chest CT and SARSCoV-2 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR)/Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) laboratory test between March 13, 2021 and June 22, 2021, were collected. COVID-19 reportingand Data System (CO-RADS) categories and the corresponding semi quantitative CTSS were calculated for each patient. Based on their vaccination status, patients were categorised into three groups: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated. The association of CTSS with various categories of vaccination status, demographics, co-morbidities and stages of the disease of the patients, was evaluated. Results: Of the 1002 COVID-19 patients, 768 (76.6%) were unvaccinated, 190 (19.0%) were partially vaccinated and 44 (4.4%) were fully vaccinated. Mean CTSS in the fully vaccinated cohort was significantly lower (3.75 +/- 4.7) than that in the partially vaccinated (6.05 +/- 5.7) and unvaccinated (8.29 +/- 4.9) patients (mean 3.75 vs. 6.05 vs. 8.29, respectively; (p<0.05). Mean CTSS in patients with no co-morbidities was significantly lower than that in patients with hypertension and diabetes (7.12 vs. 8.75 vs. 10.39, respectively; (p<0.05). Conclusion: Significant association was noted between the Chest CTSS and the vaccination status, age, gender, co-morbidities and stage of disease in this large cohort of COVID-19 patients.

Considering a reproduction number of R-0 = 3 and 70% immunization effectiveness, we estimated that at least 80% of the university population immunized through natural infection or vaccination is needed for safe university reopening with relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). By contrast, at least 60% of the university population immunized through natural infection or vaccination is needed for safe university reopening when NPIs are adopted. Nevertheless, attention needs to be paid to large-gathering events that could lead to infection size spikes. At an immunization coverage of 70%, continuing NPIs, such as wearing masks, could lead to a 78.39% reduction in the maximum cumulative infections and a 67.59% reduction in the median cumulative infections.

Although most ac-cepted this mandate, there have been several who have felt this was an unnecessary intrusion and violation of their right to choose their own health care mitigation strategies, or an infringement on their autonomy and other civil liberties. Others have argued that being a health care professional places your duties above your own self-interests, so-called fiduciary duties. As a result of these duties, there is an ex-pected obligation to do the best action to achieve the most good for society. A so-called utilitarian argument. Dis-cussion: We explore arguments both for and against these mandatory vaccine requirements and conclude using duty -and consequence-based moral reasoning to weigh the merits of each. Conclusions: Although arguments for and against vaccine mandates are compelling, it is the opinion of the Ethics Committee of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine that vaccine mandates for health care workers are ethically just and appropriate, and the benefit to society far outweighs the minor inconvenience to an individual's per-sonal liberties.

A Google search of articles published between February 2020 and September 2021 was conducted using the following search terms: 'school nurse', 'COVID-19', 'health aide', 'stress', and 'experiences'. A search was also conducted in Nexis Uni. Articles were included if the topic discussed school nurses or UAPs and COVID-19. All articles that examined nurses in other settings were excluded from the review. We examined topics and themes temporally (from February 2020 to September 2021) and spatially (i.e. the frequency by US state). Overall, 496 media articles discussing school nurses and COVID-19 were included in our review. The highest volume of articles was from September 2021 (22%, 111/496). Other months with relatively high volume of articles included August 2020 (9%, 43/496), January 2021 (10%, 47/496), February 2021 (9%, 44/496), and August 2021 (8%, 39/496). These larger article volumes coincided with notable COVID-19 events, including returning to school in the fall (August 2020 and August 2021), school nurses assisting with vaccine rollouts among adults in the USA (January/February 2021), concerns regarding the delta variant (August/September 2021), and vaccine rollouts for children ages 12-15 (September 2021). The representation of articles spatially (national, state, regional, or local) was 66 (13%) articles at national level, 217 (44%) state level, 25 (5%) regional level, and 188 (38%) local news at the city and/or village level. Pennsylvania had the highest frequency of articles, but when standardized to the state population, Alaska had the highest rate of media per 100 000 people. Three major themes were identified in our analysis: (i) safety; (ii) pandemic-related fatigue/stress; and (iii) nursing shortage/budget. The most represented theme for articles before September 2021 was that of safety. Over time, the themes of pandemic-related fatigue/stress and nursing shortage/budget increased with the most notable increase being in September 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new occupational risks, burdens, and stressors experienced by school nurses and UAPs. School nurses play a critical role in disease surveillance, disaster preparedness, wellness and chronic disease prevention interventions, immunizations, mental health screening, and chronic disease education. Furthermore, they provide a safety net for our most vulnerable children. Given that school nurses were already over-burdened and under-resourced prior to the pandemic, characterization of these new burdens and stressors will inform emergency preparedness resources for school health personnel during future pandemics or outbreaks.",,,,,,"Ravi, Priyanka/0000-0002-3432-3436",,,,,,,,,,,,,2398-7308,2398-7316,,,,JAN 12,2023,67,1,,,SI,,101,117,,10.1093/annweh/wxac053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxac053,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36111528,,,,,WOS:000854141300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most early data related to EHS during the COVID-19 pandemic came from country and regional pulse surveys conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEEF), which relied on respondent perceptions and not necessarily routine health information system (RHIS) data. By conducting a scoping review, we aimed to describe the use of RHIS data for monitoring changes in EHS coverage for maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods We performed a scoping review using Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, De -sign, Evaluation, Research type (SPIDER) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Scoping Review (PRISMA-SCR) guidelines. We includ-ed descriptive or analytic reports on the availability and use of RHIS data published in peer-reviewed, pre-publication, or gray literature on MNCH essential health services cov-erage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following databases were searched for studies published between January 2020 and May 2022: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, MedRXiv (pre-publication), Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Campbell, and Open-Grey. A single reviewer screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the retrieved pub-lications, while a second reviewer screened 20% of the total sample. Publications were tabulated by WHO Region, World Bank income group, country, data sources, study top-ic, and period. We used content analysis to qualitatively describe the trends and use of data for policy or programming in the studies.Results We included 264 publications after the full-text review. The publications came from 81 countries, covering all WHO regions and World Bank income groups. The most common data sources were hospital information systems (27%) and primary health care management information systems (26%). Most studies examined data trends before COVID-19 compared to periods during COVID-19. Most publications reported a de-crease in MNCH services (45%). Reports with follow-up beyond August 2020 (first six months of pandemic) were significantly more likely to report recovery of service coverage (8% vs 30%, P< 0.001). Low-and middle-income countries reported significantly higher morbidity and/or mortality in COVID-19 periods than high-income countries (54% vs 30%, P < 0.001). Less than 10% of reports described RHIS data quality specifically during the COVID-19 period and only 22% reported program mitigation strategies to address reductions noted from routine data.Conclusion Results suggest awareness and usefulness of RHIS to monitor MNCH service disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with only 22% of reports includ-ing descriptions of policy or program adaptations, use of RHIS data to monitor MNCH service disruptions was not necessarily followed by data-informed policies or program adaptations. RHIS data on MNCH services should be strengthened to enable its use by program man-agers and policymakers to respond to direct and indirect effects of future public health emergencies.Registration: Open Science Framework (available at: https://osf.io/usqp3/?view_only=94731785fc-ba4377adfa1bdf5754998d).",,,,,,"Jackson, Debra/0000-0003-3307-632X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2047-2978,2047-2986,,,,,2023,13,,,,,,,,6002,10.7189/jogh.13.06002,http://dx.doi.org/10.7189/jogh.13.06002,,,,,,,,36757820,,,,,WOS:000931848100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The pandemic created a situation that shocked the whole world. It led to a condition of fear, and the ones to take the major hit were the vulnerable groups: children, pregnant women, and the elderly, as well as those belonging to low socio-economic groups who lost their source of daily income. It increased the pressure on already burdened healthcare and information systems and led to a situation where the well-being of even children and pregnant women could not be maintained. COVID-19 increased the risk of undernutrition in children. Though children are observed to be less affected by the virus, they are the hidden victims of the pandemic in terms of falling prey to undernutrition. Child undernutrition can also be linked to maternal malnutrition, starting from the preconception period through the postpartum period. The situation arose due to the rapid steps of mitigation taken to tackle the pandemic, leading to decreased food security, healthcare, and education. Maternal undernutrition leads to complications for the mother during childbirth and has long-term effects on both. It can lead to low birth weight (LBW) babies, postpartum complications, chronic child undernourishment, and even increased maternal and child mortality and morbidity. Because of the pandemic's disruption of immunization facilities, it appears that even preventable childhood diseases will worsen in the coming years. In these post-COVID-19 times, it has become necessary to take measures to improve the overall health status of the population, with special regard to these vulnerable groups. Proper maternal and child health should be targeted at community levels by introducing interventions that prioritize antenatal and postnatal care, nutritional education, immunization of both mother and child, and proper health and sanitation practices. The purpose of this narrative review is to create awareness about the child survival crisis that may occur in the coming years due to undernutrition and the failure of immunization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,NOV 23,2022,14,11,,,,,,,e31823,10.7759/cureus.31823,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.31823,,,,,,,,36579224,,,,,WOS:000923606300016,View Full Record in Web of Science

MethodsThe number of weekly consultations for antenatal care (ANC), outpatient (OPD), immunisations (EPI), family planning (FP) and HIV services, between January 2018 and December 2020, were collected from 25 facilities in Masaka district, Uganda, 21 in Goma, and 29 in Kambia district, Sierra Leone. Negative binomial regression models accounting for clustering and season were used to analyse changes in activity levels between 2018, 2019 and 2020. ResultsIn Goma, we found no change in OPD, EPI or ANC consultations, FP was 17% lower in March-July 2020 compared to 2019, but this recovered by December 2020. New diagnoses of HIV were 34% lower throughout 2020 compared to 2019. In Sierra Leone, compared to the same periods in 2019, facilities had 18-29% fewer OPD consultations throughout 2020, and 27% fewer DTP3 doses in March-July 2020. There was no evidence of differences in other services. In Uganda there were 20-35% fewer under-5 OPD consultations, 21-66% fewer MCV1 doses, and 48-51% fewer new diagnoses of HIV throughout 2020, compared to 2019. There was no difference in the number of HPV doses delivered. ConclusionsThe level of disruption varied across the different settings and qualitatively appeared to correlate with the strength of lockdown measures and reported attitudes towards the risk posed by COVID-19.

As vaccination rates increase, a gap in knowledge exists regarding appropriate thresholds for escalation and de-escalation of workplace COVID-19 preventative measures. We conducted 133,056 simulation experiments, evaluating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hypothesized working environments subject to COVID-19 infections from the community. We tested the rates of workplace-acquired infections based on applied isolation strategies, community infection rates, methods and scales of testing, non-pharmaceutical interventions, variant predominance, vaccination coverages, and vaccination efficacies. When 75% of a workforce is vaccinated with a 70% efficacious vaccine against infection, then no masking or routine testing + isolation strategies are needed to prevent workplace-acquired omicron variant infections when the community infection rate per 100,000 persons is <= 1. A CIR <= 30, and <= 120 would result in no workplace-acquired infections in this same scenario against the delta and alpha variants, respectively. Workforces with 100% worker vaccination can prevent workplace-acquired infections with higher community infection rates. Identifying and isolating workers with antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 testing methods results in the same or fewer workplace-acquired infections than testing with slower turnaround time polymerase chain reaction methods. Risk migration measures such as mask-wearing, testing, and isolation can be relaxed, or escalated, in commensurate with levels of community infections, workforce immunization, and risk tolerance. The interactive heatmap we provide can be used for immediate, parameter-based case count predictions to inform institutional policy making. The simulation approach we have described can be further used for future evaluation of strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,FEB 16,2023,13,1,,,,,,,,10.1038/s41598-023-29087-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29087-w,,,,,,,,36797293,,,,,WOS:001003483300076,View Full Record in Web of Science

The prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for determining disease preventive and mitigation strategies. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and chronic cardiovascular disease can raise the risk of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), which has a greater morbidity and fatality rate. Aim: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) antibodies and their relationship to co-morbidities in Kashmir's ethnic population. Material and Methods: The present observational cohort study was done in the Department of Pulmonary Medicine at Chest Disease Hospital Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India, from September 2020 to September 2021 and 1,846 co-morbid unvaccinated patients were chosen for the study. As per standard methodology, a cohort study was undertaken, a questionnaire was prepared, and demographic and associated parameters were recorded. All participants had their immune profiles tested, and the existence of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 was determined using the chemiluminisence immunoassay technique. Chi-square and Fischer exact test were used for stastical analyses and p-value < 0.05 were taken as statistically significant. Results: As per the present study estimates, demographic and socio-economic characteristic affected test attendants. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response among co-morbid patients were found to be 54.3%. The hypertension and diabetes were most prevalent co-morbidity found in the individuals (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Co-morbidities including hypertension and diabetes in an individual are more likely have COVID-19 which can lead to death.

However, in the era of highly transmissible variants, whether it is possible for China to sustain a local containment policy and under what conditions China could transition away from it are of paramount importance at the current stage of the pandemic. Methods We developed a spatially structured, fully stochastic, individual-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission model to evaluate the feasibility of sustaining SARS-CoV-2 local containment in mainland China considering the Omicron variants, China's current immunization level, and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We also built a statistical model to estimate the overall disease burden under various hypothetical mitigation scenarios. Results We found that due to high transmissibility, neither Omicron BA.1 nor BA.2 could be contained by China's pre-Omicron NPI strategies which were successful prior to the emergence of the Omicron variants. However, increased intervention intensity, such as enhanced population mobility restrictions and multi-round mass testing, could lead to containment success. We estimated that an acute Omicron epidemic wave in mainland China would result in significant number of deaths if China were to reopen under current vaccine coverage with no antiviral uptake, while increasing vaccination coverage and antiviral uptake could substantially reduce the disease burden. Conclusions As China's current vaccination has yet to reach high coverage in older populations, NPIs remain essential tools to maintain low levels of infection while building up protective population immunity, ensuring a smooth transition out of the pandemic phase while minimizing the overall disease burden.",,,,,"Yu, Hongjie/S-7302-2019; Ajelli, Marco/AAX-1113-2020","Yu, Hongjie/0000-0002-6335-5648; Ajelli, Marco/0000-0003-1753-4749; liu, hengcong/0000-0003-2591-2201",,,,,,,,,,,,,1741-7015,,,,,NOV 15,2022,20,1,,,,,,,442,10.1186/s12916-022-02640-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02640-6,,,,,,,,36380354,,,,,WOS:000884289600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We explore how the parameters of RSV epidemiology shape the size and dynamics of post-suppression resurgence and what we can learn about them from the resurgence patterns observed so far.Methods: We developed an age-structured dynamic transmission model of RSV and sampled the parameters governing RSV seasonality, infection susceptibility and post-infection immunity, retaining simulations fitting the UK's pre-pandemic epidemiology by a set of global criteria consistent with likelihood calculations. From Spring 2020 to Summer 2021 we assumed a reduced contact frequency, returning to pre-pandemic levels from Spring 2021. We simulated transmission forwards until 2023 and evaluated the impact of the sampled parameters on the projected trajectories of RSV hospitalisations and compared these to the observed resurgence.Results: Simulations replicated an out-of-season resurgence of RSV in 2021. If unmitigated, paediatric RSV hospitalisation incidence in the 2021/22 season was projected to increase by 30-60% compared to pre-pandemic levels. The increase was larger if infection risk was primarily determined by immunity acquired from previous exposure rather than age-dependent factors, exceeding 90 % and 130 % in 1-2 and 2-5 year old children, respectively. Analysing the simulations replicating the observed early outbreak in 2021 in addition to pre -pandemic RSV data, we found they were characterised by weaker seasonal forcing, stronger age-dependence of infection susceptibility and higher baseline transmissibility.Conclusion: COVID-19 mitigation measures in the UK stopped RSV circulation in the 2020/21 season and generated immunity debt leading to an early off-season RSV epidemic in 2021. A stronger dependence of infection susceptibility on immunity from previous exposure increases the size of the resurgent season. The early onset of the RSV resurgence in 2021, its marginally increased size relative to previous seasons and its decline by January 2022 suggest a stronger dependence of infection susceptibility on age-related factors, as well as a weaker effect of seasonality and a higher baseline transmissibility. The pattern of resurgence has been complicated by contact levels still not back to pre-pandemic levels. Further fitting of RSV resurgence in multiple countries incorporating data on contact patterns will be needed to further narrow down these parameters and to better predict the pathogen's future trajectory, planning for a potential expansion of new immunisation products against RSV in the coming years.",,,,,"Koltai, Mihaly/HGD-5142-2022; Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022","Koltai, Mihaly/0000-0002-7341-5114; Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255; Flasche, Stefan/0000-0002-5808-2606; Krauer, Fabienne/0000-0001-8341-4011",,,,,,,,,,,,,1755-4365,1878-0067,,,,SEP,2022,40,,,,,,,,100614,10.1016/j.epidem.2022.100614,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2022.100614,,JUL 2022,,,,,,35901639,,,,,WOS:000835059800006,View Full Record in Web of Science
