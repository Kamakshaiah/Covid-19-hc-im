If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. In appreciating these 'capacity-dependent' deaths, this paper reports on the clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. With application to a large public hospital in England during an early stage of the pandemic, the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity. Based on information available at the time, results suggest that total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75% through a combination of increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds, reducing length of stay by 25%, and flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day. Accounting for the additional 'capacity-independent' deaths, which occur even when appropriate care is available within the intensive care setting, yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 30%. The modelling tool, which is freely available and open source, has since been used to support COVID-19 response planning at a number of healthcare systems within the UK National Health Service.",,,,,"Wood, Richard M/F-2952-2013","Wood, Richard M/0000-0002-3476-395X; Bourdeaux, Christopher/0000-0001-6620-6536; Vasilakis, Christos/0000-0002-0391-0910; McWilliams, Chris/0000-0003-3816-5217",,,,,,,,,,,,,1386-9620,1572-9389,,,,SEP,2020,23,3,,,,,315,324,,10.1007/s10729-020-09511-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10729-020-09511-7,,JUL 2020,,,,,,32642878,,,,,WOS:000546507000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, this paper argues that the draconian lockdowns instituted in Wuhan, Hubei, China, may have actually contributed to intensifying patient surges and incapacitating local health systems. Medical aids were rushed to Hubei and new hospitals were rapidly built, however, the healthcare system was still unable to match the staggering increase of patients in the early stages of the lockdowns. The paper proposes using patient evacuation to enhance sustainable COVID-19 mitigation during lockdowns. It demonstrates that patients in Hubei could have been transported to other Chinese provinces where hospitals were under-utilized. This could have theoretically saved thousands of lives by reducing inequities between Hubei and the rest of China in healthcare capacity for treating COVID-19 patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2322-5939,,,,OCT,2020,9,10,,,,,415,418,,10.34172/ijhpm.2020.63,http://dx.doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.63,,,,,,,,32610729,,,,,WOS:000573852000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

To fight against the virus, compulsory maintenance of nutritional status is very important. Age, sex, health status, medications and lifestyles are the important factors affecting individuals regarding their nutritional status. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the nutritional status of individuals is destabilized. To survive the current situation, a sustainable nutritional dietary should be maintained for strengthening the immune system. One of the most important ways to maintain the immune system is to supplement enough vitamin C. A spectrum of viruses that belongs to the coronavirus in humans usually causes the common cold, which is recently severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS considered a major threat to public health, which is an emerging infectious disease. According to WHO, COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus, in which most people probably have low immunity. Eighty-five per cent of the immune system has been made by plant-based food supplements, which increase beneficial intestinal bacteria. Minerals like zinc, magnesium, micronutrients, herbal foods and vitamins C, D and E and plenty of water promote health, which is highly helpful to overcome the infection. Many studies revealed that COVID-19 infection prevented by the powerful antioxidant glutathione and bioflavonoid quercetin; to control COVID-19, plant-based foods playing a very important role to increase the immunity of people. Leafy greens and vegetables play a very important role in food and nutritional safety. Green leafy vegetables are an excellent source of vitamins, phenolic compounds and minerals. Calcium and iron are rich in leafy vegetables than that of staple food grains. Folic acid is also present in leafy vegetables. Different leafy greens, especially Moringa oleifera leaves, contain a high amount of folic acid compared to other leafy and non-leafy vegetable plants. This review paper aims to explore the nutritional and antinutritional factors of some important leafy vegetables. The content of nutritional and antinutritional factors varies among the genera and species of most of the edible leafy vegetables. Antinutritional factors are considered the important compound in the plant, in which they determine the absorption capacity of nutrients in human beings. Important dietary factors such as phytates, oxalates, nitrates, glycosides and cyanogenic are fruitful in many health-related problems. This article mainly explores the significance of nutrition and the use of leafy vegetables to boost up the immunity system in human beings and provide reliable dietary strategies about food safety and nutrition to survive COVID-19 pandemic around the world, especially in India.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2393-9885,2278-9839,,,,JAN-JUN,2021,10,1,,,,,S257,S266,,10.21276/ap.covid19.2021.10.1.24,http://dx.doi.org/10.21276/ap.covid19.2021.10.1.24,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000688453000023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Responding to the pandemic, Sweden has taken a different approach aiming to mitigate, not suppress, community transmission, by using physical distancing without lockdowns. Here we contrast the consequences of different responses to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, intensive care, the death tolls and the associated direct healthcare related costs. Methods: We used an age-stratified health-care demand extended SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) compartmental model for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model for describing inter-municipality mobility. The model was calibrated against data from municipalities in the Stockholm healthcare region. Results: Our scenario with moderate to strong physical distancing describes well the observed health demand and deaths in Sweden up to the end of May 2020. In this scenario, the intensive care unit (ICU) demand reaches the pre-pandemic maximum capacity just above 500 beds. In the counterfactual scenario, the ICU demand is estimated to reach -20 times higher than the pre-pandemic ICU capacity. The different scenarios show quite different death tolls up to 1 September, ranging from 5000 to 41 000, excluding deaths potentially caused by ICU shortage. Additionally, our statistical analysis of all causes excess mortality indicates that the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 could be increased by 40% (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.57). Conclusion: The results of this study highlight the impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially moderate physical distancing in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals, on reducing deaths, health demands and lowering healthcare costs. In less effective mitigation scenarios, the demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed capacity, showing the tight interconnection between the healthcare demand and physical distancing in the society. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and illustrate the importance of maintaining the level of physical distancing for a longer period beyond the study period to suppress or mitigate the impacts from the pandemic.",,,,,"Johansson, Anders/D-2928-2012; Brännström, Åke/E-7850-2011","Johansson, Anders/0000-0003-0548-5943; Brannstrom, Ake/0000-0001-9862-816X; Kriit, Hedi/0000-0001-7143-5835; Rocklov, Joacim/0000-0003-4030-0449; Sjodin, Henrik/0000-0003-1235-4781",,,,,,,,,,,,,0300-5771,1464-3685,,,,OCT,2020,49,5,,,,,1443,1453,,10.1093/ije/dyaa121,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa121,,,,,,,,32954400,,,,,WOS:000606715400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Judicious implementation and relaxation of restrictions amplify their public health benefits while reducing costs. We derive optimal strategies for toggling between mitigation stages using daily COVID-19 hospital admissions. With public compliance, the policy triggers ensure adequate intensive care unit capacity with high probability while minimizing the duration of strict mitigation measures. In comparison, we show that other sensible COVID-19 staging policies, including France's ICU-based thresholds and a widely adopted indicator for reopening schools and businesses, require overly restrictive measures or trigger strict stages too late to avert catastrophic surges. As proof-of-concept, we describe the optimization and maintenance of the staged alert system that has guided COVID-19 policy in a large US city (Austin, Texas) since May 2020. As cities worldwide face future pandemic waves, our findings provide a robust strategy for tracking COVID-19 hospital admissions as an early indicator of hospital surges and enacting staged measures to ensure integrity of the health system, safety of the health workforce, and public confidence.

Therefore, the severity of Covid-19 and, thus, excess mortality have been unequal across counties. This paper explores the geography of excess mortality and its underlying factors in 2020, highlighting the effects of health policies pre-pandemic and strategies devised by governments to cope with Covid-19. Methods Excess mortality is estimated for 79 high, medium and low-income countries. The factors of excess mortality are examined employing median quantile regression analysis. Results Health privatization, healthcare underfunding, and late implementation of containment and mitigation strategies were powerful drivers of excess mortality. By contrast, the results suggest a negative association of excess mortality with health expenditure, number of doctors and hospital beds, share of population covered by health insurance and test and trace capacity. Conclusions The evidence highlights the importance of sufficiently funded healthcare systems with universal access and strong primary healthcare in the battle against the pandemic. An early response to Covid-19, including borders' controls and a strong test and trace capacity, could improve epidemiological surveillance and minimize excess mortality, with stringent and lengthy lockdowns not providing a significant benefit.",,,,,"Kapitsinis, Nikos/M-3672-2013","Kapitsinis, Nikos/0000-0002-3285-9894",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6963,,,,NOV 5,2021,21,1,,,,,,,1197,10.1186/s12913-021-07169-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07169-7,,,,,,,,34736434,,,,,WOS:000714575800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Already economically weakened by international sanctions, Iran's government was forced to consider short-term tradeoffs between public health and social stability in pandemic response, with imminent unemployment and food insecurity used to justify a policy pivot from mitigation to economic continuity. This article investigates the policy responses of Iran's government during the crucial first months of the pandemic, using data obtained through interviews structured around SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) and interpreted to elicit insights for policy capacity theory and practice. Explanations for Iran's initially ineffective pandemic response are found to include weakness in economic policy, failure to coordinate public health initiatives, priority of treatment over prevention, insufficient public engagement, and inadequate healthcare facilities. Policy recommendations emerging from the study are comprehensive and coordinated pandemic management efforts, community-based and proactive approaches, targeted economic stimulus, and a clear policy vision for crisis resolution.

As ensuring the availability of such supplies during disruptions is critical, the debate on how to increase supply chain resilience in healthcare has gained new mo-mentum. We present empirical evidence from a multi-tier case study spanning nine European medical supplies manufacturers and hospital groups. Based on the resource dependence theory, we investigated procurement -related strategies to improve medical supplies availability. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 39 procurement and supply chain management experts and derived seven propositions on buffering and bridging approaches for managing evolving resource dependencies and thereby strengthening supply chain resilience in a pandemic. Overall, we confirm the resource dependence theory's applicability for explaining companies' miti-gation measures in a pandemic disruption. We find that bridging measures within the healthcare supply base, such as offering procurement support for suppliers or leveraging long-term buyer-supplier relationships, are more effective for securing medical supplies than buffering measures. Complementing bridging with buffering, such as extended upstream procurement or resource sharing among hospitals, can lead to superior risk mitigation as capacities of the present supplier base may not suffice. Furthermore, we extend the resource dependence theory by showing that the severity of disruptions caused by a pandemic triggers new forms of buffering external to the HCSC. Both traditional and new buffering measures establish novel flows of medical supplies in the HCSC that can enable higher supply security in a pandemic.",,,,,,"Birkel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9216-2116",,,,,,,,,,,,,1478-4092,1873-6505,,,,DEC,2022,28,5,,,,,,,100748,10.1016/j.pursup.2022.100748,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pursup.2022.100748,,NOV 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000894820700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mitigation efforts created an imbalance between population health, capacity of the healthcare system and economic prosperity. Each pandemic arising from a new virus is unknown territory for policy makers, and there is considerable uncertainty of the appropriateness of responses and outcomes. Methods: A qualitative approach was used to review mixed sources of data including Australian reports, official government publications, and COVID-19 data to discern robust future responses. Publicly available epidemiological and economic data were utilised to provide insight into the impact of the pandemic on Australia's healthcare system and economy. Results: Policies implemented by the Australian Government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 impacted the healthcare sector and economy. This paper incorporates lessons learned to inform optimal economic preparedness. The rationale for an economic response plan concomitant with the health pandemic plan is explored to guide Australian Government policy makers in ensuring holistic and robust solutions for future pandemics.

This manuscript presents a System Dynamics (SD) model to analyze the healthcare system performance under various NPIs during a pandemic. The proposed model, which extends the commonly-used Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, comprises four sub -models: outbreak, hospital performance, medicine supply, and staff functionality. These sub -models work in harmony to stimulate the impact of NPIs on the disease outbreak pattern and the healthcare system's response to demand surge. The proposed model considers the uncertainty about the nature of the disease, the public's behavior, medicine availability, and medical staff efficiency. The proposed model was applied for the ex-ante evaluation of candidate NPIs adoptable against the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Consistent with the reported statistics, the results show that the peak demand can significantly exceed the healthcare system's initial ca-pacity if no action is taken. If simultaneously implemented, lockdown and testing can consider-ably delay the peak of infections, reduce its magnitude, dampen the hospital demand, and decrease mortality. The proposed model is unique as it determines the extent to which system components (e.g., community, healthcare system, and medicine supply chain) impact the observed outcomes (e.g., morbidity and mortality rates). Its structure is generic and flexible, which facilitates the extension and application of the model to evaluate candidate mitigation policies in various geographical contexts.",,,,,,"Habibi Moshfegh, Peyman/0009-0000-7768-0380; Valaei Sharif, Shahab/0000-0003-4265-7724",,,,,,,,,,,,,2212-4209,,,,,NOV,2022,82,,,,,,,,103327,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103327,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103327,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000874194900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective This study aimed to characterize the design and rapid implementation of a complex, multimodal, technology response to COVID-19 led by the Intermountain Healthcare's (Intermountain's) Care Transformation Information Systems (CTIS) organization to build pandemic surge capacity. Methods Intermountain has active community-spread cases of COVID-19 that are increasing. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pandemic Intervals Framework (the Framework) to characterize CTIS leadership's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 at Intermountain. We provide results on implementation feasibility and sustainability of health information technology (HIT) interventions as of June 30, 2020, characterize lessons learned and identify persistent barriers to sustained deployment. Results We characterize the CTIS organization's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 in five relevant areas of the Framework enabling (1) incident management, (2) surveillance, (3) laboratory testing, (4) community mitigation, and (5) medical care and countermeasures. We are seeing increased use of traditionally slow-to-adopt technologies that create additional surge capacity while sustaining patient safety and care quality. CTIS leadership recognized early that a multimodal technology intervention could enable additional surge capacity for health care delivery systems with a broad geographic and service scope. A statewide central tracking system to coordinate capacity planning and management response is needed. Order interoperability between health care systems remains a barrier to an integrated response. Conclusion The rate of future pandemics is estimated to increase.

The analyses shed light on the following questions: Are there social inequalities in worries about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection? What is the role of the regional spread of COVID-19 infections and regional healthcare capacities? Methods Based on data derived from the German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP), a representative sample of the German population aged 18 years and over, we estimated multilevel logistic regression models with individual-level (level 1) and regional-level (level 2) variables. The regional variables of interest were (a) the number of COVID-19 infections, (b) the number of hospital beds as an overall measure of the regional healthcare capacities, and (c) the number of free intensive care units as a measure of the actual capacities for treating patients with severe courses of COVID-19. Results Women, older respondents, persons with migrant background and those with a lower socioeconomic status were more likely to report worries about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection. Moreover, respondents with chronic illness, lower subjective health and those who consider COVID-19 as a threat for their own health were more likely to report worries. In addition, also regional characteristics were relevant. Worries were more common in poorer regions with higher COVID-19 infections and worse health infrastructure as indicated by the number of hospital beds. Conclusions The analysis not only indicates that several social groups are more concerned about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection, but also highlights the need for considering regional-level influences, such as the spread of the virus, poverty rates and healthcare infrastructure, when analyzing the social and health-related consequences of the pandemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,SEP 16,2022,22,1,,,,,,,1761,10.1186/s12889-022-14024-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14024-9,,,,,,,,36114486,,,,,WOS:000854508200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used a time-series epidemic model to estimate the ICU census in Daegu from the reported hospital data. Findings: Multivariate regression analysis revealed male sex, old age, and residing in Daegu city as significant risk factors for ICU admission. The number of patients requiring ICU admission exceeded the bed capacity across all Daegu hospitals before March 9, 2020, and therefore, critically ill patients were transferred to nearby hospitals outside Daegu. This finding was consistent with our prediction that the ICU census in Daegu would peak on March 16, 2020, at 160 through mitigation efforts, without which it would have reached 300 by late March 2020.

Human rights organisations raised concerns about the possibility of significant COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths in the prison system, because of the poor infrastructure, lack of healthcare and adequate COVID-19 mitigation measures, existing co-morbidities (tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis C), malnutrition and poor health of many prisoners. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a legal-realist assessment of the Malawian prison system response to COVID-19 during state disaster measures, with a specific focus on the right to health and standards of healthcare as mandated in international, African and domestic law. Findings The Malawi prison system was relatively successful in preventing serious COVID-19 outbreaks in its prisons, despite the lack of resources and the ad hoc reactive approach adopted. Whilst the Malawi national COVID plan was aligned to international and regional protocols, the combination of infrastructural deficits (clinical staff and medical provisions) and poor conditions of detention (congestion, lack of ventilation, hygiene and sanitation) were conducive to poor health and the spread of communicable disease. The state of disaster declared by the Malawi Government and visitation restrictions at prisons worsened prison conditions for those working and living there. Originality/value In sub-Saharan Africa, there is limited capacity of prisons to adequately respond to COVID-19. This is the first legal-realist assessment of the Malawian prison system approach to tackling COVID-19, and it contributes to a growing evidence of human rights-based investigations into COVID-19 responses in African prisons (Ethiopia, South Africa and Zimbabwe).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-9200,1744-9219,,,,2022 MAR 18,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/IJPH-10-2021-0108,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPH-10-2021-0108,,MAR 2022,,,,,,35294830,,,,,WOS:000772556000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the United States, carefully planned and executed pandemic policies have been neither effective nor popular and COVID-19 risk management decisions have been relegated to individual citizens and communities. In this paper, we argue that a more effective approach is to equip and strengthen community coalitions to become local learning health communities (LLHCs) that use data over time to make adaptive decisions that can optimize the equity and well-being in their communities. Methods: We used data from the North Carolina (NC) county and zip code levels from May to August 2020 to demonstrate how a LLHC could use statistical process control (SPC) charts and simple statistical analysis to make local decisions about how to respond to COVID-19. Results: We found many patterns of COVID-19 progression at the local (county and zip code) levels during the same time period within the state that were completely different from the aggregate NC state level data used for policy making. Conclusions: Systematic approaches to learning from local data to support effective decisions have promise well beyond the current pandemic. These tools can help address other complex public health issues, and advance outcomes and equity. Building this capacity requires investment in data infrastructure and the strengthening of data competencies in community coalitions to better interpret data with limited need for advanced statistical expertise. Additional incentives that build trust, support data transparency, encourage truth-telling and promote meaningful teamwork are also critical. These must be carefully designed, contextually appropriate and multifaceted to motivate citizens to create and sustain an effective learning system that works for their communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2379-6146,,,,,APR,2023,7,2,,,,,,,e10337,10.1002/lrh2.10337,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lrh2.10337,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36247203,,,,,WOS:000855281100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Society of Behavioral Medicine urges Congress to authorize increased funding to rural healthcare facilities and staffing, along with the development of enhanced broadband Internet infrastructure. In addition, incentivizing rural healthcare systems to deliver value-based care could enhance their capacity to implement population health and behavioral health strategies. To stem the spread of COVID-19 in higher-risk rural-based industries (e.g., food processing plants), SBM urges Congress to require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to routinely inspect for and enforce COVID-19 mitigation procedures, such as provision of effective Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to all front-line workers and consistent implementation of standardized testing and social distancing advisories.

Based on the joint use of a non-linear Model Predictive Control scheme and a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-based epidemiological model, the approach is aimed at minimizing the cost of the so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, mitigation strategies), while ensuring that the capacity of the network of regional healthcare systems is not violated. In addition, the proposed approach supports policy makers in taking targeted intervention decisions on different regions by an integrated and structured model, thus both respecting the specific regional health systems characteristics and improving the system-wide performance by avoiding uncoordinated actions of the regions.

COVID-19 has put the health systems in the various Arab Countries and their ability to deliver healthcare services under tremendous strain. The capacity and stability of any health system is important in any type of response to the pandemic, in order to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of care to the public through COVID-19 and beyond. The objective of this study is to identify the various response of health systems in Arab Countries to COVID-19, and highlight the legal and health challenges faced during the pandemic. The study identified both gaps and good practices that may be utilized in order to guide the efforts in response to COVID-19 and the recovery efforts once the pandemic is over. Methods: To determine why the response of some health systems in Arab Countries responses are more effective than others, a three-step framework is adopted which includes, detection, containment, and treatment stages. In order to identify which countries are excelling at detection, containment, and treatment stages, several indicators were selected for each stage. To be able to understand the legal and health challenges of response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an analysis of the health systems, the resources in terms of quality and access, health workforce, and finance was conducted. Secondary data published by the Global Burden of Disease Study, and the Global Change Data Lab of the University of Oxford was used to study identified gaps and good practices to guide the responses to COVID-19 and recovery efforts once the pandemic is over. Results: The epidemiologic record demonstrates that that certain Arab countries are managing to control the pandemic, through a combination of mitigation strategies, suppression strategy and elimination strategy. There are several barriers and challenges in Arab health systems which have been amplified due to COVID-19 and if ignored may pose a further significant challenge in the future. Health systems in Arab countries are not sufficiently equipped to handle all healthcare needs related to COVID-19, in particular issues relating to administration, equity, finances, the supply side of healthcare, and usage of information technology. Conclusion: In Arab counties, the standard response to COVID-19 was enforced by new health laws, which consist of a combination of the traditional disease control measures (testing, contact-tracing, social distancing), population-based physical distancing (including stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and social gathering bans), travel limits (including travel bans, and border closures), and economic support measures.

The disease spreading dynamics is described by an 8-compartment smooth nonlinear model of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary known from the literature, where the manipulable control input is the stringency of the introduced non-pharmaceutical measures. It is assumed that only the number of hospitalized people is measured on-line, and the other state variables are computed using a state observer which is based on the dynamic inversion of a linear sub-system of the model. The objective function contains a measure of the direct harmful consequences of the restrictions, and the constraints refer to input bounds and to the capacity of the healthcare system. By exploiting the special properties of the model, the nonlinear optimization problem required by the control design is reformulated to convex tasks, allowing a computationally efficient solution. Two approaches are proposed: the first finds a suboptimal solution by geometric programming, while the second one further simplifies the problem and transforms it to a linear programming task. Simulations show that both suboptimal solutions fulfill the design specifications even in the presence of parameter uncertainties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1367-5788,1872-9088,,,,,2021,52,,,,,,543,553,,10.1016/j.arcontrol.2021.10.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2021.10.003,,DEC 2021,,,,,,34720662,,,,,WOS:000734449000030,View Full Record in Web of Science

Global public measures have been enacted to try to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. The trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) community has overcome challenges in order to continue to deliver acute trauma care to patients and plan for challenges ahead. This review explores the lessons learnt, the priorities and the controversies that the T&O community has faced during the crisis. Historically, the experience of major incidents in T&O has focused on mass casualty events. The current pandemic requires a different approach to resource management in order to create a long-term, system-sustaining model of care alongside a move towards resource balancing and facilitation. Significant limitations in theatre access, anaesthetists and bed capacity have necessitated adaptation. Strategic changes to trauma networks and risk mitigation allowed for ongoing surgical treatment of trauma. Outpatient care was reformed with the uptake of technology. The return to elective surgery requires careful planning, restructuring of elective pathways and risk management. Despite the hope that mass vaccination will lift the pressure on bed capacity and on bleak economic forecasts, the orthopaedic community must readjust its focus to meet the challenge of huge backlogs in elective caseloads before looking to the future with a robust strategy of integrated resilient pathways.

While other countries deployed widespread testing as an early mitigation strategy, the U.S. experienced delays in development and deployment of organism identification assays. As such, there is uncertainty surrounding disease burden and community spread, severely hampering containment efforts. COVID-19 illuminates the need for a tiered diagnostic approach to rapidly identify clinically significant infections and reduce disease spread. Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies. A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients. Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity. Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messages Delayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts. A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities. The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.",,,,,"Pulia, Michael/AAB-1757-2022","Pulia, Michael/0000-0001-5809-4060",,,,,,,,,,,,,0785-3890,1365-2060,,,,JUL 3,2020,52,5,,,,,207,214,,10.1080/07853890.2020.1763449,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2020.1763449,,MAY 2020,,,,,,32370561,,,,,WOS:000534164500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding transmission, susceptibility and exposure risks is crucial for surveillance, control and response to the disease. Knowing the geographic distribution of health resource scarcity areas is necessary if a country is to adequately anticipate and prepare for the full impact of infections. We explored the potential to undertake a spatial risk assessment of an emerging pandemic under data scarcity in Eswatini. We used a set of socio-economic and demographic variables to identify epidemic risk prone areas in the country. Three risk zone levels for COVID-19 were identified in the country. The analysis showed that about 29% (320 818) of the population were located in the high risk zone and these were people who could potentially be infected with COVID-19 in the absence of mitigation measures. A majority of cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 would likely remain unknown but our estimate could be used to gauge the full burden of the disease. Approximating and quantifying the number of people who may be potentially infected with COVID19 remains impossible under data scarcity and limited healthcare capacity especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

Maternity care disruptions have been surveyed, but not those related to vulnerable small newborns. We aimed to survey reported disruptions to small and sick newborn care worldwide and undertake thematic analysis of healthcare providers' experiences and proposed mitigation strategies. Methods Using a widely disseminated online survey in three languages, we reached out to neonatal healthcare providers. We collected data on COVID-19 preparedness, effects on health personnel and on newborn care services, including kangaroo mother care (KMC), as well as disruptors and solutions. Results We analysed 1120 responses from 62 countries, mainly low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Preparedness for COVID-19 was suboptimal in terms of guidelines and availability of personal protective equipment. One-third reported routine testing of all pregnant women, but 13% had no testing capacity at all. More than 85% of health personnel feared for their own health and 89% had increased stress. Newborn care practices were disrupted both due to reduced care-seeking and a compromised workforce. More than half reported that evidence-based interventions such as KMC were discontinued or discouraged. Separation of the mother-baby dyad was reported for both COVID-positive mothers (50%) and those with unknown status (16%). Follow-up care was disrupted primarily due to families' fear of visiting hospitals (-73%).

The purpose of the current study was to report our protocols for mitigating risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between infants and eye care providers and to compare examination rates and results with the same 3-month period in 2019. METHODS During the infection surge, we added new infection control measures and strengthened existing ones. Additional personal protective equipment was used, and the number of ophthalmologists rotating in the three high-capacity NICUs we service was limited. RESULTS More infants required ROP examinations during the study period in 2020 than in the same period in 2019, but fewer examinations were performed.

Governments attempt to mitigate those challenges by either reducing healthcare demand (flattening the curve by imposing restrictions, e.g., on travel or social gatherings) or by increasing healthcare capacity, for example, by canceling elective procedures or setting up field hospitals. To implement these mitigation procedures efficiently, accurate and timely forecasts of the epidemic's progression are necessary. In this paper, we develop an innovative forecasting methodology based on the ideas of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. LSTM models are shown to outperform traditional forecasting models, especially when the relationship between input and output is complex and not available in closed form. However, whereas LSTM models perform well for data that changes dynamically over time, one shortcoming is that they are not directly applicable when the data also includes static, nontemporal components. In this work, we propose an LSTM+ model that overcomes this limitation. Our model leverages a private partnership with a mobile data company in order to capture population mobility (using mobility indices derived from mobile device data), which allows us to anticipate an epidemic's spread early and accurately. In addition, we also leverage a public partnership with a consortium of hospitals. Using hospital admissions (rather than, say, positive caseload) results in an unbiased measure of the severity of an epidemic because patients seek and are admitted to hospital care only when symptoms worsen beyond a critical point. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on forecasting COVID-19 for a major U.S. metropolitan area where it has aided decision makers of the emergency policy group. Our model improves the predictive accuracy of hospital admission by a factor of 2.5x as compared with competing models in the same analytical space.",,,,,,"Ray, Arindam/0000-0001-7706-9629",,,,,,,,,,,,,1091-9856,1526-5528,,,,MAR-APR,2023,35,2,,,,,440,457,,10.1287/ijoc.2023.1269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2023.1269,,FEB 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000955961200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Non-healthcare sectors, such as the logistics sector, play a key role in such responses. This research aims to qualitatively evaluate the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented in the UK logistics sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe conducted nine semi-structured interviews in July-August 2020 and May-June 2021. In total 11 interviewees represented six companies occupying a range of positions in the UK's logistics sector, including takeaway food delivery, large and small goods delivery and home appliance installation, and logistics technology providers. Thematic analysis was completed using NVivo12. Codes relevant to NPIs were grouped into themes and mapped deductively onto an adapted Hierarchy of Control (HoC) framework, focusing on delivery workers. Codes relevant to the implementation process of NPIs were grouped into themes/subthemes to identify key characteristics of rapid responses, and barriers and facilitators. ResultsHoC analysis suggests the sector has implemented a wide range of risk mitigation measures, with each company developing their own portfolio of measures. Contact-free delivery was the most commonly implemented measure and perceived effective. The other implemented measures included social distancing, internal contact tracing, communication and collaboration with other key stakeholders of the sector. Process evaluation identified facilitators of rapid responses including capacity to develop interventions internally, localized government support, strong external mandates, effective communication, leadership support and financial support for self-isolation, while barriers included unclear government guidance, shortage of testing capacity and supply, high costs and diversified language and cultural backgrounds. Main sustainability issues included compliance fatigue, and the possible mental health impacts of a prolonged rapid response. ConclusionsThis research identified drivers and obstacles of rapid implementation of NPIs in response to a respiratory infection pandemic. Existing implementation process models do not consider speed to respond and the absence or lack of guidance in emergency situations such as the COVID-19. We recommend the development of a rapid response model to inform the design of effective and sustainable infection prevention and control policies and to focus future research priorities.",,,,,"Wei, Hua/GPS-7682-2022; Whitfield, Carl/J-5751-2019","Whitfield, Carl/0000-0001-5913-735X; van Tongeren, Martie/0000-0002-1205-1898; Regan, Martyn/0000-0003-2962-9913; Wei, Hua/0000-0003-2617-7632; Daniels, Sarah/0000-0001-6308-9493; hall, ian/0000-0002-3033-2335",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-2565,,,,JUN 1,2022,10,,,,,,,,864506,10.3389/fpubh.2022.864506,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.864506,,,,,,,,35719658,,,,,WOS:000811350400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analysis of regional data, while hospital capacities for acute stroke care remained fully available, offers an opportunity to assess this. We report regional Stroke Team acute activations and reperfusion treatments during COVID-19 mitigation activities. Methods: Using case log data prospectively collected by a Stroke Team exclusively serving approximate to 2 million inhabitants and 30 healthcare facilities, we retrospectively reviewed volumes of consultations and reperfusion treatments for acute ischemic stroke. We compared volumes before and after announcements of COVID-19 mitigation measures and the prior calendar year. Results: Compared with the 10 weeks prior, stroke consultations declined by 39% (95% CI, 32%-46%) in the 5 weeks after announcement of statewide school and restaurant closures in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. Results compared with the prior year and time trend analyses were consistent. Reperfusion treatments also appeared to decline by 31% (95% CI, 3%-51%), and specifically thrombolysis by 33% (95% CI, 4%-55%), but this finding had less precision. Conclusions: Upon the announcement of measures to mitigate COVID-19, regional acute stroke consultations declined significantly. Reperfusion treatment rates, particularly thrombolysis, also appeared to decline qualitatively, and this finding requires further study.

Whilst these methods may work in theory, in order to implement effectively they may require information which is not likely to be available in the midst of an epidemic, or they may require impeccable data about infection levels in the community. In reality, testing and cases data can only be as good as the policy of implementation and the compliance of the individuals, which implies that accurately estimating the levels of infections becomes difficult or complicated from the data that is provided. In this paper, we demonstrate a different approach to the mathematical modelling of interventions, not based on optimality or cases, but based on demand and capacity of hospitals who have to deal with the epidemic on a day to day basis. In particular, we use data-driven modelling to calibrate a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-died type model to infer parameters that depict the dynamics of the epidemic in several regions of the UK. We use the calibrated parameters for forecasting scenarios and understand, given a maximum capacity of hospital healthcare services, how the timing of interventions, severity of interventions, and conditions for the releasing of interventions affect the overall epidemic-picture. We provide an optimisation method to capture when, in terms of healthcare demand, an intervention should be put into place given a maximum capacity on the service. By using an equivalent agent-based approach, we demonstrate uncertainty quantification on the likelihood that capacity is not breached, by how much if it does, and the limit on demand that almost guarantees capacity is not breached.",,,,,"; Madzvamuse, Anotida/F-9270-2012","Memon, Anjum/0000-0001-8256-3015; Madzvamuse, Anotida/0000-0002-9511-8903; Campillo-Funollet, Eduard/0000-0001-7021-1610; Van Yperen, James/0000-0002-0513-1494",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 3,2023,18,5,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0283350,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283350,,,,,,,,37134085,,,,,WOS:000984892100028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: The study is inspired by a process-tracing design for case study with a focus on the non-medical measures and surveillance strategies implemented by the three countries. The comprehensive collection and study of national documents formed the basis of the document analysis. Results: The Danish strategy was to prolong the transmission period, preventing high numbers of infected cases from impacting their healthcare capacity. The government's strategy was characterized by strict governance elements, health guidelines and behavioural recommendations. In Serbia, the main strategy was to prevent the spread and control of the infectious disease by shifting all human and material resources towards the function of controlling the spread. Serbia applied the strictest measures in the fight against coronavirus in relation to other countries in the region and in Europe. The Swedish strategy focused more on recommendations than requirements to motivate the public to modify their behaviours voluntarily. Sweden's loose pandemic strategy implementation focused on voluntary and stepwise action rather than legislation and compulsory measures. Conclusions: The public health policies and actions implemented to prevent community spread of COVID-19 in Denmark, Serbia and Sweden varied during the first five months of the pandemic.

J,"Santos, J",,,,"Santos, Joost",,,Using input-output analysis to model the impact of pandemic mitigation and suppression measures on the workforce,SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"The flatten the curve graphic has recently become a common tool to visualize the extent to which pandemic suppression and mitigation measures could potentially reduce and delay the number of daily infections due to a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the capacity of the many healthcare systems and created cascading economic impacts on interdependent sectors of the global society. This paper specifically explores the impact of pandemics on the workforce. The model proposed in this paper comprises of three major steps. First, sources for epidemic curves are identified to generate the attack rate, which is the daily number of infections normalized with respect to the population of the affected region. Second, the model assumes that the general attack rate can be specialized to reflect sector-specific workforce classifications, noting that each economic sector has varying dependence on the workforce. Third, using economic input-output (IO) data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, this paper analyzes the performance of several mitigation and suppression measures relative to a baseline pandemic scenario. Results from the IO simulations demonstrate the extent to which mitigation and suppression measures can flatten the curve. This paper concludes with reflections on other consequences of pandemics such as the mental health impacts associated with social isolation and the disproportionate effects on different socioeconomic groups.

We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District. Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population) were reported, with earliest illness onset March 1. The median patient age was 51 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel and an additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Among 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms were identified in 51 (9.1%). Sequencing results from 34 specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. Rural communities frequented by tourists face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study evaluated the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) coupled with alternative vaccination strategies to determine feasible Delta mitigation strategies for Australia. We aimed to understand the potential effectiveness of high vaccine coverage levels together with NPI physical distancing activation and to establish the benefit of adding children and adolescents to the vaccination program. Border closure limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Australia; however, slow vaccination uptake resulted in Delta outbreaks in the two largest cities and may continue as international travel increases. Methods An agent-based model was used to evaluate the potential reduction in the COVID-19 health burden resulting from alternative vaccination strategies. We assumed immunity was derived from vaccination with the BNT162b2 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Two age-specific vaccination strategies were evaluated, ages 5 and above, and 12 and above, and the health burden determined under alternative vaccine coverages, with/without activation of NPIs. Age-specific infections generated by the model, together with recent UK data, permitted reductions in the health burden to be quantified. Results Cases, hospitalisations and deaths are shown to reduce by (i) increasing coverage to include children aged 5 to 11 years, (ii) activating moderate NPI measures and/or (iii) increasing coverage levels above 80%. At 80% coverage, vaccinating ages 12 and above without NPIs is predicted to result in 1095 additional hospitalisations per million population; adding ages 5 and above reduces this to 996 per million population. Activating moderate NPIs reduces hospitalisations to 611 for ages 12 and over, and 382 per million for ages 5 and above. Alternatively, increasing coverage to 90% for those aged 12 and above is estimated to reduce hospitalisations to 616. Combining all three measures is shown to reduce cases to 158, hospitalisations to 1 and deaths to zero, per million population. Conclusions Delta variant outbreaks may be managed by vaccine coverage rates higher than 80% and activation of moderate NPI measures, preventing healthcare facilities from being overwhelmed. If 90% coverage cannot be achieved, including young children and adolescents in the vaccination program coupled with activation of moderate NPIs appears necessary to suppress future COVID-19 Delta-like transmission and prevent intensive care unit surge capacity from being exceeded.",,,,,"Milne, George J/C-6839-2013","Milne, George/0000-0002-9796-0600",,,,,,,,,,,,,1741-7015,,,,,FEB 18,2022,20,1,,,,,,,80,10.1186/s12916-022-02241-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02241-3,,,,,,,,35177062,,,,,WOS:000757394600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to identify published peer-reviewed articles that focused on the general community (excluding healthcare workers), NPIs (including school closure, quarantine, isolation, physical distancing and hygiene behaviours), and factors/characteristics (including social, physical, psychological, capacity, motivation, economic and demographic) that impact on engagement.ResultsThe results revealed that there are a range of demographic, social and psychological factors underpinning engagement with quarantine, school closures, and personal protective behaviours. Aside from the factors impacting on acceptance and compliance, there are several key community concerns about their use that need to be addressed including the potential for economic consequences.ConclusionIt is important that we acknowledge that these strategies will have an impact on an individual and the community.

The pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel Betacoronavirus, was subsequently isolated as the causative agent. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites and presents clinically with fever, fatigue, myalgias, conjunctivitis, anosmia, dysgeusia, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. In most critical cases, symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by a runaway inflammatory cytokine response and multiorgan failure. As of this article's publication date, COVID-19 has spread to approximately 200 countries and territories, with over 4.3 million infections and more than 290,000 deaths as it has escalated into a global pandemic. Public health concerns mount as the situation evolves with an increasing number of infection hotspots around the globe. New information about the virus is emerging just as rapidly. This has led to the prompt development of clinical patient risk stratification tools to aid in determining the need for testing, isolation, monitoring, ventilator support, and disposition. COVID-19 spread is rapid, including imported cases in travelers, cases among close contacts of known infected individuals, and community-acquired cases without a readily identifiable source of infection. Critical shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators are compounding the stress on overburdened healthcare systems. The continued challenges of social distancing, containment, isolation, and surge capacity in already stressed hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments have led to a swell in technologically-assisted care delivery strategies, such as telemedicine and web-based triage. As the race to develop an effective vaccine intensifies, several clinical trials of antivirals and immune modulators are underway, though no reliable COVID-19-specific therapeutics (inclusive of some potentially effective single and multi-drug regimens) have been identified as of yet. With many nations and regions declaring a state of emergency, unprecedented quarantine, social distancing, and border closing efforts are underway. Implementation of social and physical isolation measures has caused sudden and profound economic hardship, with marked decreases in global trade and local small business activity alike, and full ramifications likely yet to be felt.

The risks for musculoskeletal injury during routine and mass fatality mortuary operations and experiences of decedent handlers throughout the first wave of COVID-19 are presented along with mitigation strategies Methods: Awareness of the high rates of musculoskeletal injury among health care workers due to ergonomic exposures from patient handling, including heavy and repetitive manual lifting, prompted safety walkthroughs of mortuary operations at multiple hospitals within a health system in New York State by workforce safety specialists. Site visits sought to identify ergonomic exposures and ameliorate risk for injury associated with decedent handling by implementing engineering, work practice, and administrative controls. Results: Musculoskeletal exposures included manual lifting of decedents to high and low surfaces, non-neutral postures, maneuvering of heavy equipment, and push/pull forces associated with the transport of decedents Discussion: Risk mitigation strategies through participatory ergonomics, education on body mechanics, development of novel handling techniques implementing friction-reducing aides, procurement of specialized equipment, optimizing BCP design, and facilitation of communication between hospital and system-wide departments are presented along with lessons learned.

When combined with natural disasters, pandemics can further strain an already exhausted healthcare system. To date, frameworks for quantifying the collective effect of the two events on hospitals are nonexistent. Moreover, analytical methods for capturing the dynamic spatiotemporal variability in capacity and demand of the healthcare system posed by different stressors are lacking. Here, we investigate the combined impact of wildfire and pandemic on a network of hospitals. We combine wildfire data with varying courses of the spread of COVID-19 to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies for managing patient demand. We show that losing access to medical care is a function of the relative occurrence time between the two events and is substantial in some cases. By applying viable mitigation strategies and optimizing resource allocation, patient outcomes could be substantially improved under the combined hazards. COVID-19 might occur together with other natural disasters but frameworks to quantify collective effects is lacking.

J,"Burda, Z",,,,"Burda, Zdzislaw",,,Modelling Excess Mortality in Covid-19-Like Epidemics,ENTROPY,,,,,,,,,,,,"We develop an agent-based model to assess the cumulative number of deaths during hypothetical Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is R0=2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100,000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare 'do-nothing' strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.",,,,,,"Burda, Zdzislaw/0000-0002-9656-9570",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1099-4300,,,,NOV,2020,22,11,,,,,,,1236,10.3390/e22111236,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e22111236,,,,,,,,33287004,,,,,WOS:000592828700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of chemical reagent required to carry out the tests is often a bottleneck in increasing a country's testing capacity. Further, demand is unevenly spread between more affected regions (which require more tests they can perform) and less affected ones (which have spare capacity). These issues hint at the opportunity of increasing test capacity via the optimal allocation of swabs and reagent to laboratories. We prove that this is the case, proposing an Integer Programming formulation to maximise the number of tests a country can perform and validating our approach on both real-life data from Italy and synthetic instances. Our results show that increased inter-regional collaboration and a steadier supply of reagent (i.e., coming from local production sites rather than international shipments) can dramatically increase testing capacity. Accordingly, we propose short-term and long-term recommendations for policy makers and health authorities. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Mitigation efforts, like shelter-in-place orders, have taken a particular toll on parents who have had to navigate disruptions in work and/or school schedules. Research from high-income countries demonstrates increased parental anxiety, stress, depression, and burnout resulting from the pandemic. It is unclear if these outcomes are the same for parents in high-risk communities in low-income countries where pre-pandemic conditions were deleterious. This study addresses this gap and examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on parents in high-risk communities in Guatemala. Methods: A total of 330 individuals from 11 districts in Guatemala participated in the study and were assessed for sociodemographic characteristics and mental health impairment. Chi-squares were conducted for bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. Results: Bivariate analysis revealed differences between groups on burnout, with parents more often reporting feelings of burnout than nonparents (p < .001). Binary regression demonstrated that non-parents were 70% less likely to endorse feelings of stress as compared to parents (OR = .285; p = .014). Conclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the unique mental health impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on parents in high-risk communities. In high-risk communities, parental stress is a pressing problem that, if unaddressed, has the potential to result in even greater psychological distress and child maltreatment. Training community healthcare providers to assess and address parental stress can lead to increased community capacity and the development of a community-based network to serve as a first line of support for parents and their children.",,,,,"Popescu, Marciana/ABD-8283-2020","Popescu, Marciana/0000-0002-2291-1759",,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-7640,1741-2854,,,,MAY,2022,68,3,,,,,575,581,2.0764E+13,10.1177/0020764021991896,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764021991896,,JAN 2021,,,,,,33517821,,,,,WOS:000627080300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The rapid spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has led public health officials to recommend primary containment and mitigation approaches including increased hygiene, resource optimization, and social distancing. National guidelines have to this point only indirectly mentioned the pandemic's impact on reproductive medicine. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines detailed here aim to consolidate and distribute current scientific knowledge of COVID-19's impact on infertility and its treatment to healthcare providers and the patients they care for. The ASRM suggests suspension of all nonurgent care including fertility treatment, elective surgeries, and nonurgent diagnostic procedures. The recommendations issued here cover 5 domains as follows: (1) riskmitigation and social distancing, (2) patient travel, (3) practice management, (4) management of embryology and andrology laboratories, and (5) psychological health and well-being of staff and patients. Public health strategies are critical to flatten the curve of viral dissemination. The guidelines here indicate adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations spanning all medical specialties and suggest increased emphasis on minimizing necessary exposure between staff and patients through telehealth, cross-training to increase preparation for staff absences, and optimization of personal protective equipment use and supply. Nonessential patient travel should be avoided including travel for nonurgent in vitro fertilization (IVF), egg donation, or gestational surrogacy. The ASRM recommends suspension of new treatment cycles and nonurgent gamete cryopreservation. Care should be continued in all urgent cases; however, age and diminished ovarian reserve do not independently meet the definition of urgent care. Given the uncertainty on pregnancy, the fetus, and child well-being, cessation of all fresh and frozen embryo transfers should be considered. Oocyte donation cycles where the donor has already initiated ovarian stimulation may continue, as should care for all patients who are currently in cycle. Treatment should be limited to a single cycle, and those who were planning to proceed with oocyte retrieval should proceed with cryopreservation of embryos for deferred transfer. Patients with active COVID-19 should not undergo any fertility treatment unless urgent fertility preservation is required. The ASRMalso suggests sensitivity to the impact of this threat and how it manifests in both healthcare providers and patients. Increased emphasis on psychological and emotion support for both patients and staff through appropriate referrals and telemental health is recommended. This guidance includes the following key recommendations: (1) suspend initiation of new treatment cycles and nonurgent gamete cryopreservation, (2) consider cancellation of all embryo transfers whether fresh or frozen, (3) continue care for patients who are in cycle or require urgent stimulation and cryopreservation, (4) suspend elective surgeries and nonurgent diagnostic procedures, and (5) minimize in-person interactions and increase utilization of telehealth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-7828,1533-9866,,,,JUN,2020,75,6,,,,,356,357,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000562488700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results: Both RC and empathy scores increased in students after they reflected on difficulties in communication, unconscious biases, and team service-learning experiences in the course. In written reflections, they reported how their compassionate behavior also grew owing to bias mitigation.

Mapping viral transmission within and between facilities by combining genomic sequencing with epidemiologic investigations enables targeting infection-control interventions. Methods We conducted weekly surveillance of residents and staff in LTCFs in Santa Clara County, California, with >= 1 confirmed COVID-19 case between March and July 2020. Positive samples were referred for whole-genome sequencing. Epidemiological investigations and phylogenetic analyses of the largest outbreaks (>30 cases) were carried out in 6 LTCFs (Facilities A through F). Results Among the 61 LTCFs in the county, 41 had >= 1 confirmed case during the study period, triggering weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing. The 6 largest outbreaks accounted for 60% of cases and 90% of deaths in LTCFs, although the bed capacity of these facilities represents only 11% of the LTCF beds in the county. Phylogenetic analysis of 196 whole-genome sequences recovered from those facilities showed that each outbreak was monophyletic, with staff and residents sharing a common viral lineage. Outbreak investigations revealed that infected staff members often worked at multiple facilities, and in 1 instance, a staff member infected while working in 1 facility was the likely index case in another. Conclusions We detected a pattern of rapid and sustained transmission after a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in 6 large LTCF outbreaks, with staff playing a key role in transmission within and between facilities. Infection control, testing, and occupational policies to reduce exposure and transmission risk for staff are essential components to keeping facility residents safe.

We surveyed 2244 stratified random sample community members of the Gardena valley, a winter touristic area, amidst the first expansion phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. We measured agreement between Diasorin and Abbott serum bioassay outputs and the Abbott optimal discriminant threshold of serum neutralisation titres with recursive receiver operating characteristic curve. We analytically adjusted serum antibody tests for unbiased seroprevalence estimate and analysed the determinants of infection with non-response weighted multiple logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 26.9% (95% CI 25.2-28.6) by June 2020. The bioassays had a modest agreement with each other.

However, less is known about transmission in schools for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), who are often unable to mask or maintain social distancing. The objectives of this study were to determine SARS-CoV-2 positivity and in-school transmission rates using weekly screening tests for school staff and students and describe the concurrent deployment of mitigation strategies in six schools for children with IDD. Methods: From November 23, 2020, to May, 28, 2021, weekly voluntary screening for SARS-CoV-2 with a high sensitivity molecular-based saliva test was offered to school staff and students. Weekly positivity rates were determined and compared to local healthcare system and undergraduate student screening data. School-based transmission was assessed among participants quarantined for in-school exposure. School administrators completed a standardized survey to assess school mitigation strategies. Results: A total of 59 students and 416 staff participated. An average of 304 school staff and students were tested per week. Of 7289 tests performed, 21 (0.29%) new SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified. The highest weekly positivity rate was 1.2% (n = 4) across all schools, which was less than community positivity rates. Two cases of in-school transmission were identified, each among staff, representing 2% (2/103) of participants quarantined for in-school exposure. Mitigation strategies included higher than expected student mask compliance, reduced room capacity, and phased reopening. Conclusions: During 24 weeks that included the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in winter 2020-21, we found lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 screening test positivity among staff and students of six schools for children with IDD compared to community rates. In-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low among those quarantined for in-school exposure.

The pathogenic characteristics of a virus are influenced by mutations in the viral genome. Therefore, the recently identified Omicron BF.7 subvariant might harm humans. Here we aimed to evaluate the potential risks of this newly detected variant and identify possible mitigation strategies. The frequent mutation associated with SARS-CoV-2 makes it more concerning compared to other viruses. The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has unique changes in the structural amino acid. Thus, Omicron subvariants are different from other coronavirus variants in terms of viral spread, disease severity, vaccine neutralization capacity, and immunity evade. Moreover, Omicron subvariant BF.7 is an offspring of BA.4 and BA.5. Similar S glycoprotein sequences are present among BF.7, BA.4, and BA.5. There is a change in the R346T gene in the receptor binding site of Omicron BF.7 than other Omicron subvariants. This BF.7 subvariant has created a limitation in current monoclonal antibody therapy. Omicron has mutated since it emerged, and the subvariants are improving in terms of transmission as well as antibody evasion. Therefore, the healthcare authorities should pay attention to the BF.7 subvariant of Omicron. The recent upsurge may create havoc all of a sudden. Scientists and researchers across the world should monitor the nature and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Also, they should find ways to fight the current circulatory variants and any future mutations.",,,,,"Islam, Rabiul/H-1119-2018; Islam, Rabiul/Q-3277-2019","Islam, Rabiul/0000-0001-6454-4013; Islam, Rabiul/0000-0003-2820-3144",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2398-8835,,,,MAR,2023,6,3,,,,,,,e1127,10.1002/hsr2.1127,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.1127,,,,,,,,36875932,,,,,WOS:000942969400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The international randomized controlled trial CYCLE (Critical Care Cycling to Improve Lower Extremity Strength) was forced to halt recruitment at all sites in March 2020, creating immediate challenges. We applied the CONSERVE (CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstance) statement as a framework to report the impact of the pandemic on CYCLE and describe our mitigation approaches. Methods On March 23, 2020, the CYCLE Methods Centre distributed a standardized email to determine the number of patients still in-hospital and those requiring imminent 90-day endpoint assessments. We assessed protocol fidelity by documenting attempts to provide the in-hospital randomized intervention (cycling or routine physiotherapy) and collect the primary outcome (physical function 3-days post-ICU discharge) and 90-day outcomes. We advised sites to prioritize data for the study's primary outcome. We sought feedback on pandemic barriers related to trial procedures. Results Our main Methods Centre mitigation strategies included identifying patients at risk for protocol deviations, communicating early and frequently with sites, developing standardized internal tools focused on high-risk points in the protocol for monitoring patient progress, data entry, and validation, and providing guidance to conduct some research activities remotely. For study sites, our strategies included determining how institutional pandemic research policies applied to CYCLE, communicating with the Methods Centre about capacity to continue any part of the research, and developing contingency plans to ensure the protocol was delivered as intended. From 15 active sites (12 Canada, 2 US, 1 Australia), 5 patients were still receiving the study intervention in ICUs, 6 required primary outcomes, and 17 required 90-day assessments. With these mitigation strategies, we attempted 100% of ICU interventions, 83% of primary outcomes, and 100% of 90-day assessments per our protocol. Conclusions We retained all enrolled patients with minimal missing data using several time-sensitive strategies. Although CONSERVE recommends reporting only major modifications incurred by extenuating circumstances, we suggest that it also provides a helpful framework for reporting mitigation strategies with the goal of improving research transparency and trial management.",,,,,"Rochwerg, Bram/AAE-7606-2020; Pastva, Amy/AFK-5944-2022; Ball, Ian/GRR-4073-2022","Pastva, Amy/0000-0002-0891-745X; Archambault, Patrick M/0000-0002-5090-6439; Lamontagne, Francois/0000-0002-0360-3427; Kho, Michelle/0000-0003-3170-031X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1745-6215,,,,SEP 2,2022,23,1,,,,,,,735,10.1186/s13063-022-06640-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-022-06640-y,,,,,,,,36056378,,,,,WOS:000849222400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The debate has thus shifted towards the identification of mitigation strategies for minimizing disruption to the healthcare system in the case of a nationwide epidemic. To this aim, we developed an age-structured stochastic compartmental susceptible-latent-infectious-removed-susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission calibrated on the initial growth phase for the 2022 Omicron outbreak in Shanghai, to project COVID-19 burden (that is, number of cases, patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care, and deaths) under hypothetical mitigation scenarios. The model also considers age-specific vaccine coverage data, vaccine efficacy against different clinical endpoints, waning of immunity, different antiviral therapies and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that the level of immunity induced by the March 2022 vaccination campaign would be insufficient to prevent an Omicron wave that would result in exceeding critical care capacity with a projected intensive care unit peak demand of 15.6 times the existing capacity and causing approximately 1.55 million deaths. However, we also estimate that protecting vulnerable individuals by ensuring accessibility to vaccines and antiviral therapies, and maintaining implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions could be sufficient to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, suggesting that these factors should be points of emphasis in future mitigation policies. Estimates from a new modeling study suggest that current levels of vaccine coverage in China are insufficient to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, and that, if left untreated, a nationwide Omicron wave could result in up to 1.55 million deaths.",,,,,"Ajelli, Marco/AAX-1113-2020; Yu, Hongjie/GZK-5351-2022","Ajelli, Marco/0000-0003-1753-4749; Deng, Xiaowei/0000-0002-9892-2470; Cai, Jun/0000-0001-9495-1226; liu, hengcong/0000-0003-2591-2201; Yang, Juan/0000-0001-5028-2227",,,,,,,,,,,,,1078-8956,1546-170X,,,,JUL,2022,28,7,,,,,1468,+,,10.1038/s41591-022-01855-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01855-7,,MAY 2022,,,,,,35537471,,,,,WOS:000805524100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Each country, including India, has its own set of potential disasters based on the hazards present as well as the unique vulnerabilities of the community and community's preparedness to respond to particular disasters. Currently, human history is observing a very critical time fighting an invisible enemy-COVID-19. Therefore, in this study, we seek to understand the standardised measures of public hospital preparedness and resilience at times of health emergencies, including a pandemic, the most current one being COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study among health officials of district hospitals (DHs) and community health centres (CHCs) of Rajasthan using a semi-structured online questionnaire, with COVID-19 in mind, and sending it to those who had attended a training programme on disaster preparedness in hospitals. Results: In all, questionnaires were sent to 80 health officials of DHs and CHCs, of which 58 responded, with a response rate of 72.5 per cent. We collected responses on public health emergency preparedness, training-related issues, the capacity to deal with emergencies and prior experience in managing an emergency. Conclusion: The resilience and preparedness of DHs and CHCs in Rajasthan appear to be limited. From the studies it has been revealed that proper training and education on disasters like the current COVID-19, which is of significant importance for healthcare workers, is limited to only 37.9 per cent of healthcare workers. It also emerges that the staff members whenever required could mark and perform in the triage area, but the Isolation room haven't got the request facilities and equipped to stabilise a critical patient despite availability of emergency stock of medicine. The stated functional status of DHs and CHCs reveals that the level of emergency preparedness is between low and medium and also varies from hospital to hospital and from CHC to CHC. Hence, it is time to reassess and upgrade emergency preparedness plans, which include mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. Federal-, state- and local-level emergency management agencies' functioning has to be effective and well-coordinated with the local level of operation.",,,,,"Sharma, Neeraj/V-5702-2019; Sharma, Sandesh Kumar/CAF-9873-2022","Sharma, Neeraj/0000-0003-1006-6321; Sharma, Sandesh Kumar/0000-0002-1261-6406",,,,,,,,,,,,,0972-0634,0973-0729,,,,JUN,2020,22,2,,,,,146,156,9.72063E+14,10.1177/0972063420935539,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0972063420935539,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000558725200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because these mitigation strategies may be necessary for the next 6 to 18 months to prevent recurrent peaks in disease prevalence, fewer objective measurements of lung function will alter the diagnosis and care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. PFT, which includes spirometry, lung volume, and diffusion capacity measurement, is essential to the diagnosis and management of patients with asthma, COPD, and other chronic lung conditions. Both traditional and innovative alternatives to conventional testing must now be explored. These may include peak expiratory flow devices, electronic portable spirometers, portable exhaled nitric oxide measurement, airwave oscillometry devices, and novel digital health tools such as smartphone microphone spirometers and mobile health technologies along with integration of machine learning approaches. The adoption of some novel approaches may not merely replace but could improve existing management strategies and alter common diagnostic paradigms. With these options comes important technical, privacy, ethical, financial, and medicolegal barriers that must be addressed. However, the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic also presents a unique opportunity to augment conventional testing by including innovative and emerging approaches to measuring lung function remotely in patients with respiratory disease.

Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? Methods: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. Results: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment.

Aims: The aim of this paper is to explore the developments in the field of disaster nursing. Mapping key changes in policy, practice and outcomes. Methods: A qualitative interpretive historical review was conducted to examine core developments in the history of disaster nursing, examining key organisations (e.g. World Health Organization, International Council of Nurses), national and international policies and historical accounts. Results: 29 articles were analysed, and politics, strategic perspectives and nursing identity ('sense of duty' and roles) emerged from the literature. The influence of professionalisation and public health/health promotion emerged next. A total of 10 articles refer to disaster nursing specifically, of which 4 of these are reports/policy. Conclusions: Nurses have spent centuries building the trust and legitimacy of the profession. Disaster nursing goes beyond the expectations of a registered nurse. The responsibilities of a disaster nurse encompass wider community health promotion, critical decision-making beyond the individual patient, resilience and ethical challenges. Whilst significant advancements have emerged in the last 30 years, further research, and representation of the profession at a strategic and political level could enhance the effectiveness of nurses' roles in the 4 phases of disaster response: mitigation, preparation, response and recovery.",,,,,,"Fletcher, Kelsie/0000-0002-2304-6592",,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-9871,1744-988X,,,,MAY,2022,27,3,,,SI,,257,272,,10.1177/17449871211058854,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17449871211058854,,JUN 2022,,,,,,35813173,,,,,WOS:000813135100001,View Full Record in Web of Science
