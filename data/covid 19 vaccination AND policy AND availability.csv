Infection control and prevention measures potentially reduce transmission within hospitals. Aims We aimed to replicate our earlier study of London mental health in-patients to examine changes in clinical guidance and practice and associated COVID-19 prevalence and outcomes between COVID-19 waves 1 and 2 (1 March to 30 April 2020 and 14 December 2020 to 15 February 2021). Method We collected the 2 month period prevalence of wave 2 of COVID-19 in older (≥65 years) in-patients and those with dementia, as well as patients' characteristics, management and outcomes, including vaccinations. We compared these results with those of our wave 1 study. Results Sites reported that routine testing and personal protective equipment were available, and routine patient isolation on admission occurred throughout wave 2. COVID-19 infection occurred in 91/358 (25%; 95% CI 21-30%) v. 131/344, (38%; 95% CI 33-43%) P < 0.001 in wave 1. Hospitals identified more asymptomatic carriers (26/91; 29% v. 16/130; 12%) and fewer deaths (12/91; 13% v. 19/131; 15%; odds ratio = 0.92; 0.37-1.81) compared with wave 1. The patient vaccination uptake rate was 49/58 (85%). Conclusions Patients in psychiatric in-patient settings, mostly admitted without known SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a high risk of infection compared with people in the community but lower than that during wave 1. Availability of infection control measures in line with a policy of parity of esteem between mental and physical health appears to have lowered within-hospital COVID-19 infections and deaths. Cautious management of vulnerable patient groups including mental health patients may reduce the future impact of COVID-19.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We aimed to more qualitatively explore the views and perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccines in Saudi Arabia to provide recommendations to mitigate the vaccine hesitancy issue. Methods: Open-ended interviews were conducted between October 2021-January 2022. The interview guide included questions about beliefs in vaccine efficacy and safety, and previous vaccination history. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and the content was analyzed using thematic analysis. Nineteen participants were interviewed. Results: All of the interviewees were vaccine acceptors; however, three participants were hesitant as they felt they were forced to receive it. Several themes emerged as the reasons to accept or refuse the vaccine. The key reasons behind vaccine acceptance were the sense of obligation to fulfill a governmental command, trust in the government decisions, vaccine availability, and the impact of family/friends. The main reason behind vaccine hesitancy was doubts regarding vaccine efficacy and safety and that vaccines were pre-invented, and the pandemic is made-up. Participants’ sources of information included social media, official authorities, and family/friends. Conclusion: Findings from this study show that the convenience of receiving the vaccine, the abundance of credible information from the Saudi authorities, and the positive influence of family/friends were among the major factors that encouraged the public in Saudi Arabia to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Such results may inform future policies regarding encouraging the public to receive vaccines in cases of pandemic. © 2023 The Author(s)","COVID-19; SARS-CoV2; Saudi Arabia; Vaccine","influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adolescent; adult; Article; content analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; educational status; female; government; human; human experiment; interview; male; middle aged; mortality rate; pandemic; perception; qualitative research; Saudi Arabia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; social media; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; virus transmission; young adult"

In the presence of limited vaccine supply, the specific policy choice is a pressing issue for several countries worldwide, and the adopted course of action will affect the extension or easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the next months. We employ a suitably generalised, age-structure, stochastic SEIR (Susceptible ! Exposed ! Infectious ! Removed) epidemic model that can accommodate quantitative descriptions of the major effects resulting from distinct vaccination strategies. The different rates of social contacts among distinct age-groups (as well as some other model parameters) are informed by a recent survey conducted in Greece, but the conclusions are much more widely applicable. The results are summarised and evaluated in terms of the total number of deaths and infections as well as life years lost. The optimal strategy is found to be one based on fully vaccinating the elderly/at risk as quickly as possible, while extending the time-interval between the two vaccine doses to 12 weeks for all individuals below 75 years old, in agreement with epidemic theory which suggests targeting a combination of susceptibility and infectivity. This policy, which is similar to the approaches adopted in the UK and in Canada, is found to be effective in reducing deaths and life years lost in the period while vaccination is still being carried out.

To gain insight into policy responses and engage with policy-makers, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a global approach to assess and measure the impact of COVID-19 on the health workforce. As part of this, WHO, together with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), supported an impact analysis of COVID-19 on health workers and policy responses, through country case studies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods: We sought to identify lessons learned from policies on human resources for health (HRH) during health emergencies, to improve HRH readiness. First, we performed a rapid literature review for information-gathering. Second, we used the WHO interim guidance and impact measurement framework for COVID-19 and HRH to systematically organize that information. Finally, we used the Health Labour Market Framework to guide the content analysis on COVID-19 response in eight LAC countries and identify lessons learned to improve HRH readiness. Results: Planning and implementing the COVID-19 response required strengthening HRH governance and HRH data and information systems. The results suggest two main aspects for HRH governance crucial to enabling an agile response: (1) aligning objectives among ministries to define and produce regulation and policy actions; and (2) agreeing on the strategy for HRH management between the public and private sectors, and between central and local governments. We identified three areas for improvement: (a) HRH information systems; (b) methodologies to estimate HRH needs; and (c) teams to analyse information for decision-making. Three key actions were identified during countries monitored, reviewed, and updated their response stages: (i) strengthening response through primary health care; (ii); planning HRH needs to implement the vaccination plan; and (iii) securing long-term HRH availability. Conclusion: Countries coordinated and articulated with different stakeholders to align objectives, allocate resources, and agree on policy actions to implement the COVID-19 response. Data and information for HRH preparedness and implementation were key in enabling an agile COVID-19 response and are key areas to explore for improved pandemic preparedness. © 2023, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Demand; Emergency preparedness; Health Labour Market; Health workers; Supply; Working conditions","COVID-19; Humans; Latin America; Pandemics; Policy; Workforce; epidemiology; human; pandemic; policy; South and Central America"

Our research aims to assess the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and related changes in chronic care provision on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure. Design: A qualitative survey using semi-structured interviews was held among patients with COPD and heart failure. Setting and Participants: Using randomized sampling, 23 patients with COPD, heart failure, or both were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were held by phone or videocall. The survey was held during the summer of 2021, when strict national containment strategies were widely implemented but gradually loosened and vaccination was ongoing. Methods: Inductive coding using Gioia's approach was used to analyze the data in Atlas.Ti 9.1 software. Using an iterative approach, the data were synthesized in a data structure and data table, which was analyzed using an interpretative approach. Results: We found 3 aggregate dimensions in which the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on psychosocial health of patients with chronic disease: (1) perceived vulnerability to disease, (2) influence of health policy, and (3) a mismatch of supply and demand of health care. In these dimensions, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis was found to have a negative impact on psychosocial well-being, compounded by national strategies to contain the pandemic and a disruption of chronic care for patients. Conclusions and Implications: Health care providers should be aware of a multidimensional nature of psychosocial distress for chronic disease patients due to the COVID-19 crisis. Future practice and health policy could be improved by increasing awareness among health care providers, promote regular attention for psychosocial well-being of patients, provision of clear information related to the pandemic, and strategies to secure continuity of care.

An optimal policy provides the minimum number of vaccinations required to drive post-vaccination reproduction number to below one at a desired reliability level. To generate a vaccination policy, the new method considers the uncertainty in COVID-19 related parameters such as efficacy of vaccines, age-related variation in susceptibility and infectivity to SARS-CoV-2, distribution of household composition in a community, and variation in human interactions. We report on a computational study of the new methodology on a set of neighboring U.S. counties to generate vaccination policies based on vaccine availability. The results show that to control outbreaks at least a certain percentage of the population should be vaccinated in each community based on pre-determined reliability levels. The study also reveals the vaccine sharing capability of the proposed approach among counties under limited vaccine availability. This work contributes a decision-making tool to aid public health agencies worldwide in the allocation of limited vaccines under uncertainty towards controlling epidemics through vaccinations. © 2022 Gujjula et al.

People most at risk of influenza complications are disproportionately represented in people incarcerated in US prisons and jails. The objectives of this study were to survey health administrators in Massachusetts county jails about institutional influenza vaccine policies and practices and estimate influenza vaccination rates in Massachusetts jails from 2013 to 2020. Methods: In April 2020, we administered surveys to the health services administrators in Massachusetts’ 14 county jails to gather information about influenza vaccination policies and delivery practices. To calculate influenza vaccination rates for each facility, we obtained data on influenza vaccine orders from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for each county in Massachusetts for influenza seasons 2013-2020. We calculated summary statistics for each reporting facility and each year, conducted a Kruskal–Wallis analysis to compare vaccination rates between years, and used a linear regression model to identify predictors of vaccination rates. Results: Influenza vaccination rates in Massachusetts jails ranged from 1.9% to 11.8%. We found no significant differences in vaccination rates between years. Influenza vaccine ordering and delivery practices varied by jail, and respondents had high levels of confidence in influenza policies and vaccine delivery practices. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination rates in Massachusetts jails are low, and delivery practices in jails vary. Lack of influenza vaccinations in jails is a gap in health care that needs to be prioritized, especially considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further investigations for effective and equitable vaccination in this population should involve people who are incarcerated and people who make influenza vaccine policies in jails. © 2021, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","community health; correctional facilities/prisons; health policy; influenza; public health; vaccines","COVID-19; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Jails; Massachusetts; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination; influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; Article; clinical practice; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; correctional facility; health care delivery; health care management; health care need; health care policy; health service; health survey; human; influenza; Massachusetts; medical information; pandemic; pilot study; population size; prediction; vaccination coverage; correctional facility; influenza; pandemic; questionnaire; vaccination"

Patients frequently afflicted are young children and older adults, as well as the immunocompromised population. Immunization is the most effective public health strategy to combat pneumococcal disease and several vaccine formulations have been developed in this regard. Although vaccines have had a significant global impact in reducing pneumococcal disease, there are several barriers to its success in Iraq. The war and conflict situation, increasing economic crises and poverty, poor vaccine accessibility in the public sector, and high vaccine costs are a few of the major obstacles that impede a successful immunization program. The last reported third dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage for Iraq was 37% in 2019, which is expected to reduce even further owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, strategies and policies to improve pneumococcal vaccine availability and coverage need to be strengthened to achieve maximum benefits of immunization. In the current review, we provide an overview of the existing knowledge on pneumococcal disease-prevention strategies across the globe. The main aim of this manuscript is to discuss the current status and challenges of pneumococcal vaccination in Iraq as well as the strategies to prevent pneumococcal infections. © 2023 Al-Jumaili et al.","Iraq; pneumococcal disease; pneumococcal disease-prevention strategies; pneumococcal pneumonia; pneumococcal vaccines; Streptococcus pneumoniae",""

However, the scale-up of the vaccine is likely to be hindered by the widespread social media misinformation. We therefore conducted a study to assess the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Zimbabweans. Methods We conducted a descriptive online cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire among adults. The questionnaire assessed willingness to be vaccinated; socio-demographic characteristics, individual attitudes and perceptions, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the independent factors associated with vaccine uptake. Results We analysed data for 1168 participants, age range of 19–89 years with the majority being females (57.5%). Half (49.9%) of the participants reported that they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Majority were uncertain about the effectiveness of the vaccine (76.0%) and its safety (55.0%). About half lacked trust in the government’s ability to ensure availability of an effective vaccine and 61.0% mentioned that they would seek advice from a healthcare worker to vaccinate. Chronic disease [vs no chronic disease—Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.50, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)I: 1.10–2.03], males [vs females—AOR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.37–2.44] and being a healthcare worker [vs not being a health worker—AOR: 1.59, 95%CI: 1.18–2.14] were associated with increased likelihood to vaccinate. Conclusion We found half of the participants willing to vaccinate against COVID-19. The majority lacked trust in the government and were uncertain about vaccine effectiveness and safety. The policy makers should consider targeting geographical and demographic groups which were unlikely to vaccinate with vaccine information, education and communication to improve uptake. © 2022 Mundagowa et al.

These medicines will be indicated to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. These antivirals should be prescribed within 5 days of symptom onset, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been confirmed. However, the availability of these antivirals will be scarce for some time due to manufacturing constraints. Each country should establish a policy on the conditions under which these antivirals can be prescribed. Such a policy should be based on the fulfilment of five ethical elements: transparency, relevance, appeals, enforcement, and fairness. Following the principles of distributive justice, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir–ritonavir should be prescribed according to a hierarchy of predicted efficacy, ideally on the basis of an evidence-based scoring system. The placebo-controlled randomised trials that supported the temporary authorisation of these two antivirals were conducted in unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, so an evidence-based prescription practice would only use these drugs for unvaccinated patients until further data become available. However, in the countries that authorised these antivirals in 2021 (the UK and the USA), both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients meeting particular requirements have access to these antivirals. Due to the complexity of prioritisation, national health authorities should start issuing their draft policies as soon as possible and these policies should be regularly updated. The effectiveness of these antivirals against the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 must be urgently assessed. Once implemented, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir–ritonavir must show their effectiveness and safety in the real world, and health systems must be adequately adapted for the correct use of these antivirals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","Antiviral Agents; COVID-19; Humans; Ritonavir; SARS-CoV-2; Treatment Outcome; anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; molnupiravir; nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; antivirus agent; ritonavir; antiviral therapy; breakthrough infection; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug safety; health care availability; human; medical ethics; nonhuman; prescribing practice; Review; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; vaccination; vaccinee; drug therapy; treatment outcome"

The long-expected method to combat coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, that is, using an effective and widely available vaccine, has become reality by late 2020. This study was conducted prior to the national coronavirus disease 2019 mass vaccination campaign in Turkey to investigate the individual thoughts, behaviors, and expectations of the academic personnel on coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination practices, who were among the pionneers in both vaccine trials and real-time coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine jabs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Hacettepe University Medical School has a total of 1692 academic personnel. All academicians were reached through their academic email addresses and invited to participate in the survey. Busy academic routines and coronavirus disease 2019-related duties limited response number to 213 academicians, after 3 consecutive reminders at 1 week interval. The survey was conducted using a standardized, 14 question-long questionnaire, using Google forms. RESULTS: Of the 213 participants, 60.6% (n = 129) were females and the average age (± standard deviation) was 40.2 ± 12.0 years. Of all, 17.4% (n = 37) had been reportedly diagnosed to have coronavirus disease 2019 prior to vaccination. A statistically significant positive association was detected between coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination self-experience and recommending such a vaccination for relatives (P < .001); odds of recommendation was 19.5 times (95% CI = 4.2-89.6) higher among coronavirus disease 2019 vaccinated academicians compared to their non-vaccinated counterparts. CONCLUSION: Study participants are amongs the frontline workers, with expectedly the highest exposure rates from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. A significant proportion of academicians also play important role as scientific consultants and role models for the general public. Thus, their thoughts and concerns regarding public preventive measures and coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination practices are important for decisions health policy makers and administrators in charge of vaccine selection, availability, distribution, and allocation make, besides their self-responsibility in provision of evidence-based vaccine information for the general public, based on local needs and concerns. © 2022, Author(s).","academicians; CoronaVac; COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; health personnel","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; basic science; behavioral science; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; covid 19 vaccination; expectation; female; frontline staff; health care personnel; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; medical school; middle aged; occupation; questionnaire; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; staff; thinking; vaccination"

COVID-19 vaccination uptake among previously infected cancer patients may be influenced by an assumption of natural immunity, predicted weak immune response, or concerns about vaccine safety. The objective of this study was to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine uptake trends in cancer patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: Medical records of 579 sequential cancer patients undergoing active treatment at Levine Cancer Institute who tested positive for COVID-19 between January 2020 and January 2021 were evaluated. Patients who died prior to vaccine eligibility were excluded from the analysis. Demographic, clinical, and COVID-19 related characteristics were analyzed to identify prognostic factors for COVID-19 vaccine uptake as this information could be important for health policy design for future pandemics. Results: Eighty-one patients died prior to the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccination among 498 previously infected cancer patients was 54.6%. Of the patients with known vaccination dates, 76.8% received their first vaccine by April 17th, 2021. As of November 30, 2021, 23.7.% of eligible patients were boosted. In univariate models, older age, female sex, higher income, solid tumor cancer type, and hormone therapy were significantly associated with higher vaccine uptake, while Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was significantly associated with lower vaccine uptake. In a multivariable model, age (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10–1.28; p < 0.001), female sex (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.22–2.66; p = 0.003), and higher income (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.22; p = 0.032), were predictive of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Conclusions: Overall, vaccine uptake was low among our cohort of previously infected cancer patients. Older age, female sex, and higher income were the only variables associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake within this vulnerable patient population. © 2023","Cancer; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 infection; Vaccine uptake","bnt 162 b 2; ibacovavec; mRNA 1273; mrna 1273; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer patient; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug bioavailability; drug uptake; eligibility; female; Food and Drug Administration; futurology; geriatric patient; groups by sex; health care policy; highest income group; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medical record; multivariate logistic regression analysis; nonhuman; pandemic; patient attitude; prognostic assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; solid tumor; study design; univariate analysis; vulnerable population"

In the Spring of 2021, the American University of Beirut (AUB) in Lebanon spearheaded a nationwide vaccination drive with the ambitious goal of vaccinating its entire community by the beginning of the academic year 2021–2022, as the campus was due to be opened only to vaccinated individuals. This case study outlines the development, implementation, and evaluation of a social marketing campaign to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations among members of the AUB community, comprising students, faculty, staff, and dependents. Following French and Evans’ 2020 guidelines, we implemented an evidence-based and co-designed strategy to maximize the availability and facilitate vaccine access.

Education-related inequality in COVID-19 vaccine coverage and barriers within and between countries can provide insight into the hypothesised role of education as a correlate of vaccine access and acceptability. We aimed to characterise patterns of within-country education-related inequality in COVID-19 vaccine indicators across 90 countries. Methods: This study used data from the University of Maryland Social Data Science Center Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey. Data from 90 countries (more than 14 million participants aged 18 years and older) were included in our analyses. We assessed education-related inequalities globally, across country-income groupings, and nationally for four indicators (self-reported receipt of COVID-19 vaccine, structural barriers to vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine refusal) for the study period June 1–Dec 31, 2021. We calculated an absolute summary measure of inequality to assess the latest situation of inequality and time trends and explored the association between government vaccine availability policies and education-related inequality. Findings: Nearly all countries had higher self-reported receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine among the most educated respondents than the least educated respondents. Education-related inequality in structural barriers, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine refusal varied across countries, and was most pronounced in high-income countries, overall. Low-income and lower-middle-income countries reported widespread experiences of structural barriers and high levels of vaccine hesitancy alongside low levels of education-related inequality. Globally, vaccine hesitancy in unvaccinated people was higher among those with lower education and vaccine refusal was higher among those with higher education, especially in high-income countries. Over the study period, education-related inequalities in self-reported receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine declined, globally and across all country income groupings. Government policies expanding vaccine availability were associated with lower education-related inequality in self-reported receipt of vaccine. Interpretation: This study serves as a baseline for continued inequality monitoring and could help to inform targeted actions for the equitable uptake of vaccines.

The Dominican Republic, being highly vulnerable to climate change and environmental risks, needs to be prepared for national emergencies, including the current pandemic. At the time of the pandemic, the country had a weak health system and weak public funding and, in this context, experienced a significant number of confirmed cases. The country’s trajectory in terms of the number of cases, mortality, and availability of beds and intensive care units for the disease is analyzed, and the experience is compared with other countries in the Americas. As of November 2021, the Dominican Republic has been able to respond adequately, maintaining one of the lowest case-fatality rates in the region and substantially controlling its number of cases in the last year, especially after the vaccination process was initiated. The control measures implemented in the country, consisting of restrictive and timely distancing policies, are noteworthy. Likewise, the country’s successful vaccination program is being followed up as part of these measures. Regardless of the good management of the pandemic by the Dominican Republic and the positive outlook for the future in economic and social areas, the need to improve the preparedness of the country’s health system, such as increasing public spending on health and investment in the first level of care, is emphasized. © 2022 Academia Nacional de Medicina.

Investigations conducted before and after the availability of COVID-19 vaccines found the vaccinations effective. The heterogeneity was examined using stratified analyses, the meta-regression approach, and sensitivity analysis in R programming language. This meta-analysis showed that the overall COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Black/African Americans is 35% (95% CI: 26%–45%). That means 65% of Black African Americans received vaccines without any hesitancy.

Achieving high levels of vaccine coverage is key to responding to and mitigating the impact of the pandemic on health and aged care systems and the community. In many countries, vaccine hesitancy, resistance, and refusal are emerging as significant barriers to immunisation uptake and the relaxation of policies that limit everyday life. Vaccine hesitancy/ resistance/ refusal is complex and multi-faceted. Individuals and groups have diverse and often multiple reasons for delaying or refusing vaccination. These reasons include: social determinants of health, convenience, ease of availability and access, health literacy understandability and clarity of information, judgements around risk versus benefit, notions of collective versus individual responsibility, trust or mistrust of authority or healthcare, and personal or group beliefs, customs, or ideologies. Published evidence suggests that targeting and adapting interventions to particular population groups, contexts, and specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy/ resistance may enhance the effectiveness of interventions. While evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and improve uptake is limited and generally unable to underpin any specific strategy, multi-pronged interventions are promising. In many settings, mandating vaccination, particularly for those working in health or high risk/ transmission industries, has been implemented or debated by Governments, decision-makers, and health authorities. While mandatory vaccination is effective for seasonal influenza uptake amongst healthcare workers, this evidence may not be appropriately transferred to the context of COVID-19. Financial or other incentives for addressing vaccine hesitancy may have limited effectiveness with much evidence for benefit appearing to have been translated across from other public/preventive health issues such as smoking cessation. Multicomponent, dialogue-based (i.e., communication) interventions are effective in addressing vaccine hesitancy/resistance. Multicomponent interventions that encompasses the following might be effective: (i) targeting specific groups such as unvaccinated/under-vaccinated groups or healthcare workers, (ii) increasing vaccine knowledge and awareness, (iii) enhanced access and convenience of vaccination, (iv) mandating vaccination or implementing sanctions against non-vaccination, (v) engaging religious and community leaders, (vi) embedding new vaccine knowledge and evidence in routine health practices and procedures, and (vii) addressing mistrust and improving trust in healthcare providers and institutions via genuine engagement and dialogue. It is universally important that healthcare professionals and representative groups, as often highly trusted sources of health guidance, should be closely involved in policymaker and health authority decisions regarding the establishment and implementation of vaccine recommendations and interventions to address vaccine hesitancy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-vaccination movement [MeSH]; COVID-19 vaccines [MeSH]; COVID-19 [MeSH]; SARS-CoV-2 [MeSH]; Vaccination refusal [MeSH]; Vaccine [MeSH]","Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Vaccination Hesitancy; influenza vaccine; aged; attitude to health; human; patient attitude; prevention and control"

The Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) COvid Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has prospectively shown the significant global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the way in which this second wave has affected surgeons' ability to treat patients with urgent vascular conditions, using contemporaneous snapshot data from 30 UK vascular centres. METHODS: This is a contemporary (18-28 January 2021) re-run of the Tier 1 COVER survey. This used closed and open questions, related to centres' provision of common vascular services, threshold for treatment, imaging, screening, staff and theatre availability, multidisciplinary team input, clinics, personal protective equipment, vaccination policies and case-backlogs. The survey was disseminated to clinicians via email. A service reduction score was calculated. RESULTS: Forty-two complete responses were received from 30 vascular centres (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). Overall, 56.7% of units are performing only urgent procedures. The threshold for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has increased in the majority of UK centres (60%). One in six AAA screening programmes have stopped all screening activity: 30% having a significantly reduced programme and only half running as normal. Waiting lists are increasing for AAA, lower limb revascularisation and venous disease. CONCLUSION: Overall, these data suggest that vascular care in the NHS is facing unprecedented pressures due to COVID-19. Vascular stakeholders will have to urgently address these issues in the coming months.

Under the changing circumstances, we firstly apply the panel data vector autoregression (PVAR) model, using a sample of 176 countries/territories from 15 June 2021 to 15 April 2022, to estimate the potential associations among the policy responses, the progression of COVID-19 in deaths and vaccination, and medical resources possessed. Furthermore, we use the random effect method and the fixed effect speculation, to examine the determinants of policy variances across regions and over time. Our work has four main findings. Firstly, it showed the existence of a bidirectional relationship between the policy stringency and variables of interest including new daily deaths, the fully vaccinated percentage and health capacity. Secondly, conditional on the availability of vaccines, the sensitivity of policy responses to the death numbers tends to decline. Thirdly, the role of health capacity matters in coexisting with the virus mutation. Fourthly, regarding the variance in policy responses over time, the impact of new deaths tends to be seasonal. As to geographical differences in policy responses, we present the analysis for Asia, Europe, and Africa, and they show different levels of dependencies on the determinants. These findings suggest that bidirectional correlations exist in the complex context of wrestling with the COVID-19, as government interventions exert influence on the virus spread, the policy responses also progress alongside multiple factors evolving in the pandemic. This study will help policymakers, practitioners, and academia to formulate a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between policy responses and the contextualized implementation factors. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; deaths; health capacity; policy response; vaccination coverage","Africa; COVID-19; Humans; Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Africa; Asia; Europe; COVID-19; health policy; mortality; policy approach; policy implementation; vaccination; vaccine; Africa; Article; Asia; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; Europe; geography; health care availability; human; mortality; pandemic; public policy; seasonal variation; vaccination; vaccinee; virus mutation; virus transmission; policy"

COVID-19 outbreaks reported in pilgrimages and religious ceremonies around the world—especially in the first wave of the pandemic wave—and the role played by religion in conveying culturally sensitive information about COVID-19 are some of the evidence we reviewed.

Anxiety about vaccines and vaccination programs leading to vaccine hesitancy results from a complex mix of social and political influences, cultural and religious beliefs, the availability of and ability to interpret health and scientific information, and personal and population experiences of health systems and government policies. Vaccine hesitancy is becoming a serious threat to vaccination programs, and was identified as one of the World Health Organization’s top ten global health threats in 2019. The negative impact of anti-vaccination movements is frequently cited as one of the major reasons for rising vaccine hesitancy amongst the general public world-wide. This review discusses the various issues surrounding vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement, starting with the definitions of vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement in their early history and in the modern era, before discussing the key drivers of vaccine hesitancy, particularly across different regions of the world, with a focus on various countries with low-, middle-, or high-income economies with different socio-economic populations. The review concludes with the impact of vaccine hesitancy on herd immunity and social, psychological, and public health measures to counter vaccine hesitancy. © 2022 by the authors.","anti-vaccine movement; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; vaccines","diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; Human papilloma virus vaccine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; Mycobacterium vaccine; poliomyelitis vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; smallpox vaccine; swine influenza vaccine; thiomersal; anti-vaccination movement; anxiety; autism; behavior change; bulbar poliomyelitis; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia; cowpox; decision making; Guillain Barre syndrome; health care personnel; health care policy; high income country; human; immune response; immunization; influenza; measles; mumps; pertussis; pneumonia; prevalence; psychologic assessment; public health; Review; Rotavirus; rubella; Simian virus 40; smallpox; social media; socioeconomics; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine preventable disease; World Health Organization"

We evaluated the effect of age-specific vaccination strategies on the number of infections and deaths using an SEIR model, considering the age structure and social contact patterns for different age groups for each of different countries. In general, the vaccination priority should be given to those younger people who are active in social contacts to minimize the number of infections, while the vaccination priority should be given to the elderly to minimize the number of deaths. But this principle may not always apply when the interaction of age structure and age-specific social contact patterns is complicated. Partially reopening schools, workplaces or households, the vaccination priority may need to be adjusted accordingly. Prematurely reopening social contacts could initiate a new outbreak or even a new pandemic out of control if the vaccination rate and the detection rate are not high enough. Our result suggests that it requires at least nine months of vaccination (with a high vaccination rate > 0.1%) for Italy and India before fully reopening social contacts in order to avoid a new pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology.","Age structure; COVID-19 control; Reopening policy; Social contact; Vaccination strategy","Age Factors; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Mathematical Concepts; Models, Biological; Policy; Vaccination; age; aged; biological model; human; mathematical phenomena; policy; vaccination"

However, very little attention has been paid to the role of individual and built environmental factors in decline in older adults’ daily mobility during the pandemic. Methods: Based on a cohort survey of 741 older adults in Hong Kong, we conducted a one-way ANOVA to explore the differences in determinants (individual or environmental factors) of older adults’ daily mobility between before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, multilevel linear regression was performed to examine how individual characteristics and built environment factors are associated with changes in older adults’ daily mobility during the pandemic. Results: Results show that the duration of active travel declined from 174.72 to 76.92 min per week, and that the public transport use frequency decreased from an average of 6.14 to 3.96 trips per week during the COVID-19 pandemic (before the rollout of vaccination programme). We also found residential density (p < 0.05) and the number of bus stop was negatively associated with the decline in their active travel (p < 0.01), while a higher destination mix was associated with more significant decrease in active travel (p < 0.01). A higher availability of recreational facilities in neighbourhoods was associated with a greater decrease in public transport use (p < 0.05). In addition, those who were older or having depressive symptoms, which are considered a vulnerable group, were negatively associated with decrease in their mobility (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Maintaining mobility and social interactions are crucial for older adults’ health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study found that individual and environmental factors differentially affected older adults’ active travel and public transport use during the pandemic. Our findings contribute to understanding the COVID-19 impact on daily mobility in older adults and support more effective active travel promotion policies in the post-pandemic future. © 2022, The Author(s).","Active travel; Hong Kong; Post-pandemic; Public transport use; Travel behaviour","Aged; Built Environment; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Residence Characteristics; Transportation; aged; demography; epidemiology; human; pandemic; traffic and transport"

Contrary to early predictions that sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) would bear a disproportionate share of the burden of COVID-19 due to the region's vulnerability to other infectious diseases, weak healthcare systems, and socioeconomic conditions, the pandemic's effects in SSA have been very mild in comparison to other regions. Interestingly, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and disease-induced deaths in SSA remain low, despite the loose implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and the low availability and administration of vaccines. Possible explanations for this low burden include epidemiological disparities, under-reporting (due to limited testing), climatic factors, population structure, and government policy initiatives. In this study, we formulate a model framework consisting of a basic model (in which only susceptible individuals are vaccinated), a vaccine-structured model, and a hybrid vaccine-age-structured model to assess the dynamics of COVID-19 in West Africa (WA). The framework is trained with a portion of the confirmed daily COVID-19 case data for 16 West African countries, validated with the remaining portion of the data, and used to (i) assess the effect of age structure on the incidence of COVID-19 in WA, (ii) evaluate the impact of vaccination and vaccine prioritization based on age brackets on the burden of COVID-19 in the sub-region, and (iii) explore plausible reasons for the low burden of COVID-19 in WA compared to other parts of the world. Calibration of the model parameters and global sensitivity analysis show that asymptomatic youths are the primary drivers of the pandemic in WA. Also, the basic and control reproduction numbers of the hybrid vaccine-age-structured model are smaller than those of the other two models indicating that the disease burden is overestimated in the models which do not account for age-structure. This result is confirmed through the vaccine-derived herd immunity thresholds. In particular, a comprehensive analysis of the basic (vaccine-structured) model reveals that if 84%(73%) of the West African populace is fully immunized with the vaccines authorized for use in WA, vaccine-derived herd immunity can be achieved. This herd immunity threshold is lower (68%) for the hybrid model. Also, all three thresholds are lower (60% for the basic model, 51% for the vaccine-structured model, and 48% for the hybrid model) if vaccines of higher efficacies (e.g., the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine) are prioritized, and higher if vaccines of lower efficacy are prioritized. Simulations of the models show that controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in WA (by reducing transmission) requires a proactive approach, including prioritizing vaccination of more youths or vaccination of more youths and elderly simultaneously. Moreover, complementing vaccination with a higher level of mask compliance will improve the prospects of containing the pandemic. Additionally, simulations of the model predict another COVID-19 wave (with a smaller peak size compared to the Omicron wave) by mid-July 2022. Furthermore, the emergence of a more transmissible variant or easing the existing measures that are effective in reducing transmission will result in more devastating COVID-19 waves in the future. To conclude, accounting for age-structure is important in understanding why the burden of COVID-19 has been low in WA and sustaining the current vaccination level, complemented with the WHO recommended NPIs is critical in curbing the spread of the disease in WA. © 2022 The Authors","AVAT; Herd immunity; Omicron variant; Reproduction number; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine prioritization","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Africa; age distribution; aged; Article; asymptomatic infection; basic reproduction number; calibration; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; disease risk assessment; epidemic; government; health care system; hospitalization; human; immune system; immunity; mathematical model; mortality; pandemic; reproduction; sensitivity analysis; simulation; socioeconomics; vaccination; virus transmission; vulnerability"

Nonetheless, certain governments have instituted vaccine passport policies (VPPs) to manage public health, raising mixed concerns from the public. Focusing on COVID-19 outbreak as an example, this review and commentary article utilises an institutional theory perspective to uncover the factors contributing to the global vaccine divide. We also explore the wider impact of VPPs to determine whether such tools promote freedom or social exclusion. Our insights shed light on a controversial and increasingly divisive policy with an international dimension and institutional implications. For instance, while some argue that VPPs may be relatively better than the blunt instrument of lockdowns, VPPs also implicate access and discrimination concerns. Given the various reasons for global vaccine disparities, a hybrid policy that combines vaccine passports with other public health practices (e.g., rapid lateral flow/affordable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and good hygiene) may be more viable. Furthermore, while VPPs may not be desirable and acceptable domestically, they may be inevitable for international travel. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; health crisis; institutional theory; social exclusion; vaccine passport","Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Policy; Humans; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; COVID-19; policy approach; public health; social exclusion; vaccination; vaccine; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; disinformation; financial management; health care access; health care availability; health care cost; health care disparity; health care policy; health promotion; health service; human; institutional review; lockdown; misinformation effect; polymerase chain reaction; practice guideline; Review; social discrimination; social exclusion; travel; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; communicable disease control; epidemiology; health care policy; prevention and control; public health"

Indeed, the pandemic has impacted many aspects of their daily routine, changing their social and health habits and food-related behaviors. There is now no approved therapy, and vaccination is the only clinical preventative measure that provides the highest protection against the virus. While these vaccines have been beneficial in curbing the pandemic's effect, they may also influence food-related behaviors. Accordingly, this paper aims to investigate the impact of vaccination availability on university students' food shopping and consumption habits, vaccine-related opinions, and back on-campus behaviors in Jordan. The research is based on an online survey conducted in Jordan using a structured questionnaire and distributed through Google Forms between January 1 and March 20, 2022. A total of 624 valid answers were collected. The findings revealed no significant changes in the way students consumed, shopped, and handled food compared to the pre-vaccine period. However, there is a slight post-vaccine trend toward shopping more groceries online and ordering more meals via delivery apps and takeout services. Regarding health-related food choices, there was an increase in the consumption of healthy food, water, and fruits and vegetables. Further, following the availability of the vaccination, students' adoption of COVID-19 food-related habits was maintained. Gender, engagement in food preparation activities, and living status (e.g., whether or not living with parents) substantially affected several food-related behaviors. The findings are expected to guide both current emergency preparations and long-term food-related policies in Jordan.

In the early stages, the number of available doses was limited. To maximize the effectiveness of the vaccine campaign, the national health agency assigned priority access to at-risk individuals, such as health care workers and the elderly. Current vaccination campaign strategies do not take full advantage of the latest mathematical models, which capture many subtle nuances, allowing different territorial situations to be analyzed aiming to make context-specific decisions. Objectives: The main objective is the definition of an agent-based model using open data and scientific literature to assess and optimize the impact of vaccine campaigns for an Italian region. Specifically, the aim is twofold: (i) estimate the reduction in the number of infections and deaths attributable to vaccines, and (ii) assess the performances of alternative vaccine allocation strategies. Methods: The COVID-19 Agent-based simulator Covasim has been employed to build an agent-based model by considering the Lombardy region as case study. The model has been tailored by leveraging open data and knowledge from the scientific literature. Dynamic mobility restrictions and the presence of Variant of Concern have been explicitly represented. Free parameters have been calibrated using the grid search methodology. Results: The model mimics the COVID-19 wave that hit Lombardy from September 2020 to April 2021. It suggests that 168,492 cumulative infections 2,990 cumulative deaths have been avoided due to the vaccination campaign in Lombardy from January 1 to April 30, 2021. Without vaccines, the number of deaths would have been 66% greater in the 80–89 age group and 114% greater for those over 90. The best vaccine allocation strategy depends on the goal. To minimize infections, the best policy is related to dose availability. If at least 1/3 of the population can be covered in 4 months, targeting at-risk individuals and the elderly first is recommended; otherwise, the youngest people should be vaccinated first. To minimize overall deaths, priority is best given to at-risk groups and the elderly in all scenarios. Conclusions: This work proposes a methodological approach that leverages open data and scientific literature to build a model of COVID-19 capable of assessing and optimizing the impact of vaccine campaigns. This methodology can help national institutions to design regional mathematical models that can support pandemic-related decision-making processes. © 2022","Agent-based model; Covasim; COVID-19; Epidemiologic model; Vaccination; Variants of concern","Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Personnel; Humans; Immunization Programs; Pandemics; Vaccination; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Health risks; Knowledge management; Open Data; Risk perception; Simulation platform; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Agent-based model; Allocation strategy; Case-studies; Covasim; Epidemiologic model; Large-scales; Open datum; Scientific literature; Vaccination; Variant of concern; adult; aged; antibody response; Article; calibration; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; death toll; health service; high risk population; human; immunity; mathematical model; retrospective study; scientific literature; seroprevalence; simulation; vaccination; variant of concern; epidemiology; health care personnel; pandemic; prevention and control; preventive health service; vaccination; COVID-19"

In this context, accurate estimations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies based on antibody tests metrics (e.g., specificity and sensitivity) and the study of population characteristics are essential. Here, we propose a Bayesian analysis using IgA and IgG antibody levels through multiple scenarios regarding data availability from different information sources to estimate the seroprevalence of health professionals in a Northeastern Brazilian city: no data available, data only related to the test performance, data from other regions. The study population comprises 432 subjects with more than 620 collections analyzed via IgA/IgG ELISA tests. We conducted the study in pre- and post-vaccination campaigns started in Brazil. We discuss the importance of aggregating available data from various sources to create informative prior knowledge. Considering prior information from the USA and Europe, the pre-vaccine seroprevalence means are 8.04% and 10.09% for IgG and 7.40% and 9.11% for IgA. For the post-vaccination campaign and considering local informative prior, the median is 84.83% for IgG, which confirms a sharp increase in the seroprevalence after vaccination. Additionally, stratification considering differences in sex, age (younger than 30 years, between 30 and 49 years, and older than 49 years), and presence of comorbidities are provided for all scenarios. © 2022","Bayesian inference; COVID-19; Databases; Serological Diagnosis; Seroprevalence","Adult; Antibodies, Viral; Bayes Theorem; Brazil; COVID-19; Humans; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; SARS-CoV-2; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Vaccines; Brazil; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; vaccine; virus antibody; Bayesian analysis; COVID-19; database; disease prevalence; estimation method; health worker; serum; vaccine; age; antibody blood level; Article; Bayes theorem; Brazil; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 serological testing; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Europe; gender; health practitioner; human; seroprevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; United States; vaccination; adult; epidemiology; prevention and control; seroepidemiology"

Contrary to widely held perceptions, the problem of misuse, abuse, and diversion of prescription opioids has been the least of all the factors in recent years. Consequently, it is important to properly distinguish between the role of illicit and prescription opioids in the current opioid crisis. Multiple efforts have been based on consensus on administrative policies for certain harm reduction strategies for individuals actively using illicit drugs and reducing opioid prescriptions leading to curbing of medically needed opioids, which have been ineffective. While there is no denial that prescription opioids can be misused, abused, and diverted, the policies have oversimplified the issue by curbing prescription opioids and the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of severely limiting prescription opioids, without acknowledgement that opioids have legitimate uses for persons suffering from chronic pain. Similar to the opioid crisis, interventional pain management procedures have been affected by various policies being applied to reduce overuse, abuse, and finally utilization. Medical policies have been becoming more restrictive with reduction of access to certain procedures, with the pendulum swinging too far in the direction of limiting interventional techniques. Recent utilization assessments have shown a consistent decline for most interventional techniques, with a 18.7% decrease from 2019 to 2020. The causes for these dynamic changes are multifactorial likely including the misapplication of the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, the relative ease of access to illicit synthetic opioids and more recently issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, recent publications have shown association of dose tapering with overdose or mental health crisis among patients prescribed long-term opioids. These findings are leading to the hypothesis that federal guidelines may inadvertently be contributing to an increase in overall opioid deaths and diminished access to interventional techniques. Together, these have resulted in a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic. Methods: A narrative review. Results: The fourth wave results from a confluence of multiple factors, including misapplication of CDC guidelines, the increased availability of illicit drugs, the COVID-19 pandemic, and policies reducing access to interventional procedures. The CDC guidelines and subsequent regulatory atmosphere have led to aggressive tapering up to and including, at times, the overall reduction or stoppage of opioid prescriptions. Forced tapering has been linked to an increase of 69% for overdoses and 130% for mental health crisis. The data thus suggests that the diminution in access to opioid prescriptions may be occurring simultaneously with an increase in illicit narcotic use. Combined with CDC guidelines, the curbing of opioid prescriptions to medically needed individuals, among non-opioid treatments, interventional techniques have been affected with declining utilization rates and medical policies reducing access to such modalities. Conclusion: The opioid overdose waves over the past three decades have resulted from different etiologies. Wave one was associated with prescription opioid overdose deaths and wave two with the rise in heroin and overdose deaths from 1999 to 2013. Wave three was associated with a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths. Sadly, wave four continues to escalate with increasing number of deaths as a confluence of factors including the CDC guidelines, the COVID pandemic, increased availability of illicit synthetic opioids and the reduction of access to interventional techniques, which leads patients to seek remedies on their own. © 2022, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

The continuous emergence of new and deadly pathogens has highlighted the need to reflect upon past experiences to improve pandemic preparedness. The aim of this study was to examine the development and rollout of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine and knowledge challenges for the effective implementation of vaccination programs for COVID-19 and future influenza pandemics. Methods: A systematic review was conducted searching EMBASE (inception to current date) and PUBMED (from January 2009 to current date) databases for relevant published studies about influenza A(H1N1) pandemic vaccines. A Google search was conducted to identify relevant documents from gray literature. Selected Studies were reviewed and summarized. Results: A total of 22, comprising of 12 original studies and 10 relevant documents met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen papers reported an initial high demand that outweighed production capacity and caused vaccine shortages. Vaccine procurement and supply were skewed toward high-income countries. Low vaccination rates of about 5%-50% were reported in all studies mainly due to a low-risk perception of getting infected, safety concerns, and the fear of adverse effects. Conclusions: Safety concerns about the approved H1N1 vaccines resulted in many unsuccessful vaccination campaigns worldwide. Understanding the factors that influence people's decision to accept or refuse vaccination, effective risk communication strategies, adequate resources for vaccine deployment initiatives and building local capacities through shared knowledge and technology transfer may help to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake and accelerate pandemic control. © 2022 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.","COVID-19 vaccine; H1N1 vaccine; Pandemic influenza; Pandemic preparedness; Vaccination; vaccine development","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Vaccination; Vaccine Development; influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; influenza vaccine; 2009 H1N1 influenza; Article; clinical study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; drug manufacture; drug safety; fear; health care access; health care availability; health care planning; health care policy; high income country; human; Influenza A virus (H1N1); influenza vaccination; medical information; medical research; nonhuman; pandemic influenza; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; program evaluation; public health; public health campaign; risk perception; systematic review; vaccination coverage; vaccination refusal; vaccine development; influenza; Influenza A virus (H1N1); prevention and control; vaccination"

Number of countries offering vaccines in second year of life (2YL) has increased, but use of 2YL for catch-up vaccination has been variable. We assessed pre-pandemic use of 2YL for catch-up vaccination in three countries (Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa), based on existence of a 2YL platform (demonstrated by offering second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) in 2YL), proportion of card availability, and geographical variety. Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of immunization data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in Pakistan (2017–2018), the Philippines (2017), and South Africa (2016). We conducted time-to-event analyses for pentavalent vaccine (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-Hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib]) and MCV and calculated use of 2YL and MCV visits for catch-up vaccination. Results: Among 24–35-month-olds with documented dates, coverage of third dose of pentavalent vaccine increased in 2YL by 2%, 3%, and 1% in Pakistan, Philippines, and South Africa, respectively. MCV1 coverage increased in 2YL by 5% in Pakistan, 10% in the Philippines, and 3% in South Africa. In Pakistan, among 124 children eligible for catch-up vaccination of pentavalent vaccine at time of a documented MCV visit, 45% received a catch-up dose. In the Philippines, among 381 eligible children, 38% received a pentavalent dose during an MCV visit. In South Africa, 50 children were eligible for a pentavalent vaccine dose before their MCV1 visit, but only 20% received it; none with MCV2. Conclusion: Small to modest vaccine coverage improvements occurred in all three countries through catch-up vaccination in 2YL but many missed opportunities for vaccination continue to occur. Using the 2YL platform can increase coverage and close immunity gaps, but immunization programmes need to change policies, practices, and monitor catch-up vaccination to maximize the potential. © 2022","Catch-up vaccination; Demographic and Health Survey (DHS); Immunization; Life course; Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV); Vaccination timeliness","Child; COVID-19; Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine; Humans; Immunization Programs; Immunization Schedule; Infant; Measles Vaccine; Pakistan; Philippines; South Africa; Vaccination; Vaccines, Combined; diphtheria pertussis tetanus Haemophilus influenzae type b hepatitis B vaccine; measles vaccine; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; measles vaccine; vaccine; adolescent; adult; Article; catch up vaccination; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; demographics; diphtheria; female; geography; Haemophilus influenzae infection; health survey; hepatitis B; human; immunity; immunization; measles; Pakistan; pertussis; Philippines; preschool child; secondary analysis; South Africa; tetanus; timeliness; vaccination; infant; preventive health service; vaccination"

As COVID-19 is becoming endemic and charges for regular booster vaccination are being introduced, measuring public acceptance and the willingness to pay for regular COVID-19 boosters is ever more crucial. Objective: This study aims to (1) investigate public acceptance for regular COVID-19 boosters, (2) assess the willingness to pay for a COVID-19 booster shot, and (3) identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Our results will provide crucial insights into and implications for policy response as well as the development of a feasible and effective vaccination campaign during Vietnam’s waning vaccine immunity period. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 871 Vietnamese online participants from April to August 2022. An online questionnaire based on the discrete choice experiment (DCE) design was developed, distributed using the snowball sampling method, and subsequently conjointly analyzed on the Qualtrics platform. A history of COVID-19 infection and vaccination, health status, willingness to vaccinate, willingness to pay, and other factors were examined. Results: Among the participants, 761 (87.4%) had received or were waiting for a COVID-19 booster shot. However, the willingness to pay was low at US $8.02, and most participants indicated an unwillingness to pay (n=225, 25.8%) or a willingness to pay for only half of the vaccine costs (n=222, 25.4%). Although information insufficiency and a wariness toward vaccines were factors most associated with the unwillingness to pay, long-term side effects, immunity duration, and mortality rate were the attributes the participants were most concerned with during the vaccine decision-making period. Participants who had children less than 18 years old in their homes infected with COVID-19 had a lower willingness to pay (odds ratio [OR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.39-0.74). Respondents who had children under 12 years old in their family who received at least 1 vaccine dose had a higher willingness to pay (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12-3.66). The burden of medical expenses (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.25-0.45) and fear of the vaccine (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86-1.00) were negative factors associated with the level of willingness to pay. Conclusions: A significant inconsistency between high acceptance and a low willingness to pay underscores the role of vaccine information and public trust. In addition to raising awareness about the most concerning characteristics of the COVID-19 booster, social media and social listening should be used in collaboration with health professionals to establish a 2-way information exchange. Work incentives and suitable mandates should continue to encourage workforce participation. Most importantly, all interventions should be conducted with informational transparency to strengthen trust between the public and authorities. © Bach Xuan Tran, Anh Linh Do, Laurent Boyer, Pascal Auquier, Huong Thi Le, Minh Ngoc Le Vu, Trang Huyen Thi Dang, Khuy Minh Cao, Linh Dieu Thi Le, Lam Tung Ngoc Cu, Bang Viet Ly, Duong Anh Thi Nguyen, Manh Duc Nguyen, Carl A Latkin, Roger C M Ho, Cyrus S H Ho, Melvyn W B Zhang.","acceptability; booster; COVID-19; epidemic; feasibility; infection; intervention; policy; social media; vaccination; vaccine; Vietnam; willingness to pay; willingness to take","Adolescent; Child; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Southeast Asian People; Vietnam; adolescent; child; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; human; prevention and control; Viet Nam"

Objectives: To support decision-makers in formulating COVID-19 immunization policy in the context of limited vaccine availability and evolving variants over time, we evaluate optimal strategies for Covid-19 vaccination in Brazil in 2021, when vaccination was rolled out during Gamma variant predominance. Methods: Using a discrete-time epidemic model we estimate Covid-19 deaths averted, considering the currently Covid-19 vaccine products and doses available in Brazil; vaccine coverage by target population; and vaccine effectiveness estimates. We evaluated a 5-month time horizon, from early August to the end of December 2021. Optimal vaccination strategies compared the outcomes in terms of averted deaths when varying dose intervals from 8 to 12 weeks, and choosing the minimum coverage levels per age group required prior to expanding vaccination to younger target populations. We also estimated dose availability required over time to allow the implementation of optimal strategies. Results: To maximize the number of averted deaths, vaccine coverage of at least 80 % should be reached in older age groups before starting vaccination into subsequent younger age groups. When evaluating varying dose intervals for AZD1222, reducing the dose interval from 12 to 8 weeks for the primary schedule would result in fewer COVID-19 deaths, but this can only be implemented if accompanied by an increase in vaccine supply of at least 50 % over the coming six-months in Brazil. Conclusion: Covid-19 immunization strategies should be tailored to local vaccine product availability and supply over time, circulating variants of concern, and vaccine coverage in target population groups. Modelling can provide valuable and timely evidence to support the implementation of vaccination strategies considering the local context, yet following international and regional technical evidence-based guidance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Immunization; Modelling; Vaccines","Aged; Brazil; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; ad26.cov2.s vaccine; coronavac; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; vaxzevria; vaccine; adult; aged; Article; Brazil; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; evidence based practice; female; hospitalization; human; immunization; male; middle aged; mortality rate; mouse; nonhuman; rat; retrospective study; SARS-CoV-2 Gamma; vaccination; very elderly; epidemiology; prevention and control; vaccination"

Each phase required a different governance response. With the progress of the pandemic, data were collected, evidence was created, and health technology was developed and disseminated. Policymaking shifted from protecting the population by limiting infections with non-pharmaceutical interventions to controlling the pandemic by prevention of severe disease with vaccines and drugs for those infected. Once the vaccine became available, the state started devolving the responsibility for the individual’s health and behavior. Main body: Each phase of the pandemic posed new and unique dilemmas for policymakers, which resulted in unprecedented decision-making. Restrictions to individual’s rights such as a lockdown or the ‘Green Pass policy’ were unimaginable before the pandemic. One of the most striking decisions that the Ministry of Health made was approving the third (booster) vaccine dose in Israel, before it was approved by the FDA or any other country. It was possible to make an informed, evidence-based decision due to the availability of reliable and timely data. Transparent communication with the public probably promoted adherence to the booster dose recommendation. The boosters made an important contribution to public health, even though their uptake was less than the uptake for the initial doses. The decision to approve the booster illustrates seven key lessons from the pandemic: health technology is key; leadership is crucial (both political and professional); a single body should coordinate the actions of all stakeholders involved in the response, and these should collaborate closely; policymakers need to engage the public and win their trust and compliance; data are essential to build a suitable response; and nations and international organizations should collaborate in preparing for and responding to pandemics, because viruses travel without borders. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic posed many dilemmas for policymakers. The lessons learned from the actions taken to deal with them should be incorporated into preparedness for future challenges. © 2023, The Author(s).","COVID-19 vaccine booster; Decision-making; Health policy; Pandemic response","Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Decision Making; Health Policy; Humans; Israel; Pandemics; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; booster vaccination campaign; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; decision makers; decision making; emergency decision making; evidence based decision; green pass policy; health care concepts; human; immunization; international organization; Israel; leadership; lockdown; named groups of persons; pandemic; policymakers; public health; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; stakeholder engagement; unprecedented decision making; vaccination; communicable disease control; decision making; epidemiology; health care policy; pandemic; prevention and control"

Given concerns with access, acceptability, and hesitancy across Africa, there is a need to describe the current status of vaccine uptake in the continent. An exploratory study was undertaken to investigate these aspects, current challenges, and lessons learnt across Africa to provide future direction. Senior personnel across 14 African countries completed a self-administered questionnaire, with a descriptive analysis of the data. Vaccine roll-out commenced in March 2021 in most countries. COVID-19 vaccination coverage varied from low in Cameroon and Tanzania and up to 39.85% full coverage in Botswana at the end of 2021; that is, all doses advocated by initial protocols versus the total population, with rates increasing to 58.4% in Botswana by the end of June 2022. The greatest increase in people being fully vaccinated was observed in Uganda (20.4% increase), Botswana (18.5% increase), and Zambia (17.9% increase). Most vaccines were obtained through WHO-COVAX agreements. Initially, vaccination was prioritised for healthcare workers (HCWs), the elderly, adults with co-morbidities, and other at-risk groups, with countries now commencing vaccination among children and administering booster doses. Challenges included irregular supply and considerable hesitancy arising from misinformation fuelled by social media activities. Overall, there was fair to reasonable access to vaccination across countries, enhanced by government initiatives. Vaccine hesitancy must be addressed with context-specific interventions, including proactive programmes among HCWs, medical journalists, and the public. © 2022 by the authors.","African countries; availability; challenges; COVID-19; hesitancy; policy implications; social media; vaccination","coronavac; elasomeran; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; vaxzevria; wibp-corv vaccine; adverse event; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; exploratory research; financial management; health care; health care access; health care personnel; human; immunization; infection rate; journalism; mortality; pandemic; questionnaire; social acceptance; social media; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccine development; vaccine hesitancy"

Methods: The road map was developed through consultative meetings with countries’ focal points, review of relevant literature and policy documents and analysis of WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on immunization ((JRF 2015–2020) data. Countries were categorised into three groups, based on the existence of influenza vaccination policy and national regulatory authority, availability of influenza vaccine in the country and number of influenza vaccine doses distributed/ 1000 population. The final road map was shared with representatives of all countries in Eastern Mediterranean Region and other stakeholders during a meeting in September 2021. Result: The goal for next 5 years is to increase access to and use of utilization of seasonal influenza vaccine in Eastern Mediterranean Region to reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality among priority groups for vaccination. Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region are at different stages of implementation of the influenza vaccination program, so activities are planned under four strategic priority areas based on current situations in countries. The consultative body recommended that some countries should establish a new seasonal influenza vaccination programme and ensure the availability of vaccines, while other countries need to reduce vaccine hesitancy and enhance current seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, particularly in all high-risk groups. Countries are also encouraged to leverage COVID-19 adult vaccination programs to improve seasonal influenza vaccine uptake. Conclusion: This road map was developed through a consultative process to scale up the uptake and utilization of influenza vaccine in all countries of Eastern Mediterranean Region. The road map proposes activities that should be adopted in the local context to develop/ update national policies and programs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adult vaccine program; COVID-19; Eastern Mediterranean Region; Influenza; Influenza vaccine","Adult; COVID-19; Humans; Immunization Programs; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Mediterranean Region; Vaccination; influenza vaccine; Article; drug utilization; health care availability; health program; human; immunization; influenza; mass immunization; vaccination coverage; vaccination refusal; adult; influenza; preventive health service; Southern Europe; vaccination"

Even as progress has been made through vaccinations, issues associated with labor are still arising. Increasing wages is a strategy to enhance labor productivity and, also to ameliorate, in part, labor shortages, but has not, until this work, been explored in a full supply chain network context. Specifically, in this paper, a game theory supply chain network model is constructed of firms competing in producing a substitutable, but differentiated, product, and seeking to determine their equilibrium product path flows, as well as hourly wages to pay their workers, under fixed labor amounts associated with links, and wage-responsive productivity factors. The theoretical and computational approach utilizes the theory of variational inequalities. We first introduce a model without wage bounds on links and then extend it to include wage bounds. Lagrange analysis is conducted for the latter model, which yields interesting insights, as well as an alternative variational inequality formulation. A series of numerical examples reveals that firms can gain in terms of profits by being willing to pay higher wages, resulting in benefits also for their workers, as well as consumers, who enjoy lower demand market prices for the products. However, sensitivity analysis should be conducted to determine the range of such wage bounds. Ultimately, we observed, that the profits may decrease and then stabilize. This work adds to the literature on the integration of concepts from economics and operations research for supply chain networks and also has policy implications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Game theory; Labor; Networks; Productivity; Supply chains; Wages","Computation theory; Lagrange multipliers; Operations research; Productivity; Profitability; Public policy; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Variational techniques; Wages; % reductions; Labor shortages; Labour productivities; Lagrange; Network; Network activities; Product shortages; Supply chain network; Variational inequalities; Workers'; Game theory"

Methods: A targeted review of literature was conducted to collect relevant data from official government documents, national as well as international databases, media reports and published research articles. The data were summarized to assess Indian government's vaccination campaign and its outcomes as a response to COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The five-point strategy adopted by government of India was “COVID appropriate behaviour, test, track, treat and vaccinate”. With respect to vaccination, there have been periodic shifts in the policies in terms of eligible beneficiaries, procurement, and distribution plans, import and export strategy, involvement of private sector and use of technology. The government utilized technology for facilitating vaccination for the beneficiaries and monitoring vaccination coverage. Conclusion: The monopoly of central government in vaccine procurement resulted in bulk orders at low price rates. However, the implementation of liberalized policy led to differential pricing and delayed achievement of set targets. The population preference for free vaccines and low profit margins for the private sector due to price caps resulted in a limited contribution of the dominant private health sector of the country.

The aim of this review is to update a practical immunization prevention guideline for CAP in Spain caused by prevalent respiratory pathogens, based on the available scientific evidence through extensive bibliographic review and expert opinion. The emergence of COVID-19 as an additional etiological cause of CAP, together with the rapid changes in the availability of vaccines and recommendations against SARS-CoV-2, justifies the need for an update. In addition, new conjugate vaccines of broader spectrum against pneumococcus, existing vaccines targeting influenza and pertussis or upcoming vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) will be very useful prophylactic tools to diminish the burden of CAP and all of its derived complications. In this manuscript, we provide practical recommendations for adult vaccination against the pathogens mentioned above, including their contribution against antibiotic resistance. This guide is intended for the individual perspective of protection and not for vaccination policies, as we do not pretend to interfere with the official recommendations of any country. The use of vaccines is a realistic approach to fight these infections and ameliorate the impact of antimicrobial resistance. All of the recently available scientific evidence included in this review gives support to the indications established in this practical guide to reinforce the dissemination and implementation of these recommendations in routine clinical practice. © 2023 by the authors.","antimicrobial resistance; community-acquired pneumonia; COVID-19; influenza vaccination; influenza vaccines; pertussis; pneumococcal conjugate vaccines; pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; VRS","conjugate vaccine; influenza vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; polysaccharide vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; antibiotic resistance; clinical practice; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; human; Human respiratory syncytial virus; immunization; influenza; influenza vaccination; morbidity; mortality; pertussis; prophylaxis; Review; serotype; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Spain; Streptococcus pneumoniae; vaccination"

This has important consequences for SARS-CoV-2 variant spread and for future uptake of influenza and other vaccines. We examine these phenomena in Missouri, where its low vaccination rates, high levels of uninsured residents, predominance of conservative values, and stark rural-urban divides are intricately connected to public health resistance. The Socio-Ecological model guides our approach. Methods: We use data from the Fall 2020 Midwestern University (MWU—a pseudonym) Study of Seropositivity and Risk for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 which are harmonized with the American Community Survey, Missouri County-Level Study, and the USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to estimate multi-level regression models on the relationship between undergraduate students’ “home” locales and their own COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy. Findings: The availability of primary care physicians, the prevalence of influenza vaccinations, and location type at the county level, as well as the percentage of residents without health insurance at the zip code level differentially predict COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: There is a link between county-level health and geographic characteristics, and individuals’—who were influenced by those counties because that is where their parents live—hesitancy towards vaccines. Identifying feasible, precise, local solutions to reducing vaccine hesitancy could take place if community members and other stakeholders would be open to changes in local-level health policy or practice. © 2022 by the authors.","college students; COVID-19; influenza; population health; vaccines","COVID-19; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Vaccination; Vaccination Hesitancy; Vaccines; Missouri; United States; influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; COVID-19; disease spread; disease transmission; influenza; public health; vaccine; adult; Article; college student; coronavirus disease 2019; country economic status; economic status; female; general practitioner; geography; health care access; health care availability; health insurance; home; home locale; human; infection risk; influenza; influenza vaccination; male; multiple regression; population health; prevalence; residence characteristics; undergraduate student; urban area; vaccine hesitancy; influenza; pandemic; prevention and control; student; vaccination"

Methods: We analyzed the COVID-19 propagation in Italy starting from September 2021 with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that takes into account SARS-CoV-2 lineages, intervention measures and efficacious vaccines. The model was calibrated with the Bayesian method Conditional Robust Calibration (CRC) using COVID-19 data from September 2020 to May 2021. Here, we apply the Conditional Robustness Analysis (CRA) algorithm to the calibrated model in order to identify model parameters that most affect the epidemic diffusion in the long-term scenario. We focus our attention on vaccination and intervention parameters, which are the key parameters for long-term solutions for epidemic control. Results: Our model successfully describes the presence of new variants and the impact of vaccinations and non-pharmaceutical interventions in the Italian scenario. The CRA analysis reveals that vaccine efficacy and waning immunity play a crucial role for pandemic control, together with asymptomatic transmission. Moreover, even though the presence of variants may impair vaccine effectiveness, virus transmission can be kept low with a constant vaccination rate and low restriction levels. Conclusions: In the long term, a policy of booster vaccinations together with contact tracing and testing will be key strategies for the containment of SARS-CoV-2 spread. © 2022, The Author(s).","Conditional robustness analysis; COVID-19; Italy; ODE model","Bayes Theorem; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Viral Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; virus vaccine; Article; asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019; Bayes theorem; Conditional Robust Calibration; contact examination; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; data analysis; drug effect; drug efficacy; geographic distribution; hospital patient; human; infection control; Italy; pandemic; quantitative analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; statistical analysis; susceptible exposed infectious recovered model; vaccination; variant of concern; virus transmission; epidemiology; genetics; prevention and control; vaccination"

It is unknown whether disparities in pandemic-related mortality across occupational sectors have continued to occur during the periods of SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine availability. Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study, we obtained data from the California Department of Public Health on all deaths occurring in the state of California, USA, from Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021. We restricted our analysis to residents of California who were aged 18–65 years at time of death and died of natural causes. We classified the occupational sector into nine essential sectors; non-essential; or unemployed or without an occupation provided on the death certificate. We calculated the number of COVID-19 deaths in total and per capita that occurred in each occupational sector. Separately, using autoregressive integrated moving average models, we estimated total, per-capita, and relative excess natural-cause mortality by week between March 1, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, stratifying by occupational sector. We additionally stratified analyses of occupational risk into counties with high versus low vaccine uptake, categorising high-uptake regions as counties where at least 50% of the population were fully vaccinated according to US guidelines by Aug 1, 2021. Findings: From March 1, 2020, to Nov 30, 2021, 24 799 COVID-19 deaths were reported in residents of California aged 18–65 years and an estimated 28 751 (95% prediction interval 27 853–29 653) excess deaths. People working in essential sectors were associated with higher COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths than were those working in non-essential sectors, with the highest per-capita COVID-19 mortality in the agriculture (131·8 per 100 000 people), transportation or logistics (107·1 per 100 000), manufacturing (103·3 per 100 000), facilities (101·1 per 100 000), and emergency (87·8 per 100 000) sectors. Disparities were wider during periods of increased infections, including during the Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021, surge in infections, which was driven by the delta variant (B.1.617.2) and occurred during vaccine uptake. During the June 27 to Nov 27, 2021 surge, emergency workers had higher COVID-19 mortality (113·7 per 100 000) than workers from any other sector. Workers in essential sectors had the highest COVID-19 mortality in counties with low vaccination uptake, a difference that was more pronounced during the period of the delta infection surge during Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021. Interpretation: Workers in essential sectors have continued to bear the brunt of high COVID-19 and excess mortality throughout the pandemic, particularly in the agriculture, emergency, manufacturing, facilities, and transportation or logistics sectors. This high death toll has continued during periods of vaccine availability and the delta surge. In an ongoing pandemic without widespread vaccine coverage and with anticipated threats of new variants, the USA must actively adopt policies to more adequately protect workers in essential sectors.

These studies addressed areas of concern such as the high infection and mortality risk of patients on in-centre haemodialysis and transplant recipients. However, the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from these studies has in some instances been challenging, owing to barriers in aspects of usual care, data limitations and problematic methodological practices. In many settings, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing differed substantially between patient groups, whereas the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection varied over time and place because of differences in viral prevalence, targeted public health policies and vaccination rates. The absence of baseline kidney function data posed problems in the classification of chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury in some studies, potentially compromising the generalizability of findings. Study findings also require attentive appraisal in terms of the effects of confounding, collider bias and chance. As this pandemic continues and in the future, the implementation of sustainable and integrated research infrastructure is needed in settings across the world to minimize infection transmission and both prevent and plan for the short-term and long-term complications of infectious diseases.

Over 10,000 HCWs in Africa have been infected with COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization, making it a substantial occupational health threat for HCWs. To that end, Somalia’s Ministry of Health has ordered that all healthcare personnel obtain the COVID-19 vaccination to safeguard themselves and the community they serve. In this investigation, we aimed to assess the COVID-19 vaccination coverage and its associated factors among healthcare workers in Somalia. A cross-sectional study was employed to examine COVID-19 vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel in Somalia. The data were obtained via an online questionnaire supplied by Google forms between December 2021 and February 2022, where a total of 1281 healthcare workers from the various federal states of Somalia were recruited. A multinomial regression analysis was used to analyse the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Overall, 1281 HCWs participated (630 females, 651 males) with a mean age and standard deviation of 27.7 years ± 7.1. The overall vaccine coverage was 37.4%. Sex, age, the state of residency, education level, specialization, hospital COVID-19 policy, vaccine availability at the centre, COVID-19 treatment centre, and health facility level were the factors that influenced the COVID-19 vaccine uptake among health professionals in Somalia. Male healthcare employees were 2.2 times (odds ratio-OR = 2.2; confidence interval-CI: 1.70, 2.75, p < 0.001) more likely than female healthcare workers to be fully vaccinated. The survey discovered that the COVID-19 vaccine coverage among health professionals was quite low, with the major contributing factors being accessibility, security challenges and literary prowess. Additional efforts to enhance vaccination uptake are needed to improve the COVID-19 vaccination coverage. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; healthcare workers; Somalia; vaccine uptake","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; age; Article; asthma; cardiovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; educational status; female; health care availability; health care personnel; health care policy; human; hypertension; male; middle aged; primary health care; questionnaire; residence characteristics; secondary care center; sex; Somalia; specialization; tertiary care center; vaccination coverage; vaccine availability; vaccine hesitancy; young adult"

Israel was one of the first countries to vaccinate its population, inaugurating the program on December 20, 2020. The objective of the current study is to investigate the projected daily COVID19 mortality growth rate with higher median age and population size of cities under two scenarios: with and without the BNT162b2 Pfizer vaccination against the SAR-COV2 virus. Methods: This study employs a panel data-set. We follow the COVID19 mortality growth rate in each of the 173 Israeli cities and towns starting from March 21, 2020 (10 days after the first documentation of COVID19 cases in Israel) until September 21, 2021, where the BNT162b2 Pfizer vaccinations were available starting from December 20, 2020. Results: Referring to the median age of municipal residents, findings suggest that the BNT162b2 Pfizer vaccinations attenuate the rise in anticipated daily mortality growth rate for cities and towns in which the median population age is 30 years old (the range in median age among the residents in the municipalities surveyed is 11–41 years). Moreover, referring to population size of cities, findings demonstrate that while under the scenario without vaccination, the daily mortality growth rate is anticipated to rise, under a comparable scenario with vaccination, daily mortality growth rate is anticipated to drop. Conclusions: In crowded cities, where the median age is high, two perspectives of early and intensive public policy interventions are clearly required. The first perspective is extensive medical treatment, namely, extension of availability of medical physical and online services; dispensing designated medications; expansion of hospitalization facilities and information services particularly to susceptible populations. All measures will be taken with attention to age accessibility of these means. The second perspective is prevention via establishment of testing and vaccination complexes; elevation of dedicated health services, generating selective lockdowns; education for increasing awareness to social distancing, wearing masks and other preventive means. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Mortality","Adolescent; Adult; BNT162 Vaccine; Child; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Israel; Population Density; Public Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; age; anticipation; Article; awareness; city; confidence interval; coronavirus disease 2019; education; growth rate; health service; hospitalization; human; information service; Israel; leisure; lockdown; mortality; population density; population size; predictive model; resident; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; vaccination; adolescent; adult; child; communicable disease control; epidemiology; population density; prevention and control; public policy; young adult"

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of parents of children between 5 and 11 years of age among the Jewish population in Israel (n = 1,012). The survey was carried out between September 23 and October 4, 2021, at a critical time, immediately after Pfizer’s announcement. Two multivariate regressions were performed to determine predictors of parents’ intention to vaccinate their 5-11-year-old children against COVID-19. Results: Overall, 57% of the participants reported that they intend to vaccinate their 5-11-year-old children against COVID-19 in the winter of 2022. 27% noted that they would vaccinate their 5-11-year-old children immediately; 26% within three months; and 24% within more than three months. Perceived susceptibility, benefits, barriers and cues to action, as well as two incentives - vaccine availability and receiving a “Green Pass” - were all significant predictors. However, Incentives such as monetary rewards or monetary penalties did not increase the probability of parents’ intention to vaccinate their children. Parental concerns centered around the safety of the vaccine, fear of severe side effects, and fear that clinical trials and the authorization process were carried out too quickly. Conclusion: This study provides data on the role of incentives in vaccinating 5-11-year-old children, how soon they intend to do so, and the predictors of those intentions, which is essential knowledge for health policy makers planning vaccination campaigns. © 2023, The Author(s).","Health belief model; Incentives; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine acceptance","Child; Child, Preschool; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Intention; Motivation; Parents; Vaccination; behavior; child; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; human; motivation; preschool child; prevention and control; vaccination"

Design Remote qualitative interviews and focus groups (FGs) conducted June-October 2020 before UK COVID-19 vaccine approval. Data were transcribed and analysed through inductive thematic analysis and mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework. Setting England and Wales. Participants 100 participants from 19 self-identified ethnic groups. Results Mistrust and doubt were reported across ethnic groups. Many participants shared concerns about perceived lack of information about COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy. There were differences within each ethnic group, with factors such as occupation and perceived health status influencing intention to accept a vaccine once made available. Across ethnic groups, participants believed that public contact occupations, older adults and vulnerable groups should be prioritised for vaccination. Perceived risk, social influences, occupation, age, comorbidities and engagement with healthcare influenced participants' intentions to accept vaccination once available. All Jewish FG participants intended to accept, while all Traveller FG participants indicated they probably would not. Facilitators to COVID-19 vaccine uptake across ethnic groups included: desire to return to normality and protect health and well-being; perceived higher risk of infection; evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy; vaccine availability and accessibility. COVID-19 information sources were influenced by social factors and included: friends and family; media and news outlets; research literature; and culture and religion. Participants across most different ethnic groups were concerned about misinformation or had negative attitudes towards the media. Conclusions During vaccination rollout, including boosters, commissioners and providers should provide accurate information, authentic community outreach and use appropriate channels to disseminate information and counter misinformation. Adopting a context-specific approach to vaccine resources, interventions and policies and empowering communities has potential to increase trust in the programme.  © ","COVID-19; Infection control; Public health; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH","Aged; Attitude; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; England; Ethnicity; Humans; Information Sources; Vaccination; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; adult; aged; Article; Asian; attitude to health; Black person; Caucasian; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cultural factor; drug efficacy; drug information; drug safety; England; ethnic group; family; female; friend; health belief; health care access; health care availability; health care utilization; health status; human; infection risk; information processing; interview; Jew; male; mass medium; medical literature; middle aged; misinformation; multiracial person; occupation; publication; qualitative research; religion; social aspect; thematic analysis; travel; United Kingdom; vaccination; vaccination refusal; vaccine hesitancy; very elderly; Wales; attitude; ethnicity; prevention and control"

As the world charts a way towards an equitable and resilient recovery, Public Health and Social Measures (PHSMs) that were implemented since the beginning of the pandemic need to be made a permanent feature of health systems that can be activated and readily deployed to tackle sudden surges in infections going forward. Although PHSMs aim to blunt the spread of the virus, and in turn protect lives and preserve health system capacity, there are also unintended consequences attributed to them. Importantly, the interactions between PHSMs and their accompanying key indicators that influence the strength and duration of PHSMs are elements that require in-depth exploration. This research employs case studies from six Asian countries, namely Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, to paint a comprehensive picture of PHSMs that protect the lives and livelihoods of populations. Nine typologies of PHSMs that emerged are as follows: (1) physical distancing, (2) border controls, (3) personal protective equipment requirements, (4) transmission monitoring, (5) surge health infrastructure capacity, (6) surge medical supplies, (7) surge human resources, (8) vaccine availability and roll-out and (9) social and economic support measures. The key indicators that influence the strength and duration of PHSMs are as follows: (1) size of community transmission, (2) number of severe cases and mortality, (3) health system capacity, (4) vaccine coverage, (5) fiscal space and (6) technology. Interactions between PHSMs can be synergistic or inhibiting, depending on various contextual factors. Fundamentally, PHSMs do not operate in silos, and a suite of PHSMs that are complementary is required to ensure that lives and livelihoods are safeguarded with an equity lens. For that to be achieved, strong governance structures and community engagement are also required at all levels of the health system.  © ","COVID-19; Health policy; Health systems; Public Health","Article; Asia; community transmission; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; economic security; health care facility; health care policy; health care system; health workforce; human; Indonesia; mass immunization; medical technology; mortality; pandemic; Philippines; public health; Singapore; social aspect; social distancing; South Korea; Thailand; thematic analysis; travel restriction; vaccination coverage; Viet Nam"

Such mandates have sparked debates on the freedom to choose whether or not to get vaccinated. In this study, we examined the people’s belief in vaccine choice as a predictor of willingness to get vaccinated among a sample of unvaccinated individuals in Italy. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Italy in May 2021. The survey collected data on respondents’ demographics and region of residence, socioeconomic factors, belief in the freedom to choose to be vaccinated or not, risk perception of contracting and transmitting the disease, previous vaccine refusal, opinion on adequacy of government measures to address the pandemic, experience in requesting and being denied government aid during the pandemic, and intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination. The analysis employed binary logistic regression models using a hierarchical model building approach to assess the association between intent to accept vaccination and belief in the freedom to choose to vaccinate, while adjusting for other variables of interest. 984 unvaccinated individuals were included in the study. Respondents who agreed that people should be free to decide whether or not to vaccinate with no restrictions on their personal life had 85% lower odds of vaccine acceptance (OR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09,0.23) after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors and their risk perception of contracting and transmitting COVID-19. Belief in the freedom to choose whether or not to accept vaccinations was a major predictor of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among a sample of unvaccinated individuals in Italy in May 2021. This understanding of how individuals prioritize personal freedoms and the perceived benefits and risks of vaccines, when making health care decisions can inform the development of public health outreach, educational programs, and messaging. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; vaccine freedom; vaccine hesitancy","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; education; female; freedom; government; health care personnel; human; hypertension; Italy; knowledge; major clinical study; male; occupation; perception; pharmacist; public health; quality control; questionnaire; risk perception; smoking; socioeconomics; vaccination; vaccination refusal; vaccine hesitancy; work environment"

Among providers of different specialities, it is critical to protect those working in hospital settings with a high risk of infection. Using an agent-based simulation model, various staffing policies were developed and simulated for 90 days using data from the largest health systems in South Carolina. The model considers staffing policies that include geographic segregation, interpersonal contact limits, and a combination of factors, including the patient census, transmission rates, vaccination status of providers, hospital capacity, incubation time, quarantine period, and interactions between patients and providers. Comparing the existing practices to various risk-adjusted staffing policies, model predictions show that restricted teaming and rotating schedules significantly (p-value <0.01) reduced weekly HCW unavailability and the number of infected HCWs by 22% and 38%, respectively, when the vaccination rates among HCWs were lower (<75%). However, as the vaccination rate increases, the benefits of risk-adjusted policies diminish; and when 90% of HCWs were vaccinated, there were no significant (p-value = 0.09) benefits. Although these simulated outcomes are specific to one health system, our findings can be generalised to other health systems with multiple locations.  © 2023 The Author(s).

This work brings together the phenomena of increased inequality and health inequities felt by the poor and young working class of the Philippines and how they interact negatively with existing vaccine policies. The poor and the young were more likely to have experienced employment disruptions with limited access to technologies that allowed for teleworking. Informal economy workers suffered from diminished labor protection and draconian lockdowns. Disadvantaged areas persistently dealt with limited health resources, and the working class was disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Utilitarian vaccine policies such as mandatory vaccination and the prioritization scheme negatively interacted with these COVID-induced inequalities and health inequities. While the young working class was more likely to be unemployed, mandatory vaccine policy required that they get vaccinated before seeking re-employment. However, the prioritization scheme adopted by the government failed to target them as a priority. This left them in a vulnerable state of prolonged unemployment while on standby for better supply and improved infrastructure for vaccine rollout. Future prospects in terms of economic recovery and health equity will be affected by issues such as potential increased taxation, the rapidly digitalizing labor market that is evolving to favor highly-skilled workers, and the staging of universal healthcare in the country. © 2023 by the authors.","inequality; Philippines; public health; vaccine; vaccine policy","Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Philippines; Public Policy; Vaccination; Philippines; accessibility; COVID-19; health impact; health policy; labor supply; policy approach; public health; skilled labor; vaccination; young population; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; economic aspect; employment discrimination; health care availability; health care disparity; health care policy; health care system; health care utilization; health equity; human; Philippines; social status; unemployment; universal health care; vaccination; vulnerable population; communicable disease control; epidemiology; Philippines; prevention and control; public policy; vaccination"

Developing countries are the most affected by this hazardous and toxic medical waste due to poor management systems. In recent years, Bangladesh has experienced increasing medical waste generation with estimated growth of 3 % per year. The existing healthcare waste management in Bangladesh is far behind the sustainable waste management concept. To achieve an effective waste management structure, Bangladesh has to implement life cycle assessment (LCA) and circular economy (CE) concepts in this area. However, inadequate data and insufficient research in this field are the primary barriers to the establishment of an efficient medical waste management systen in Bangladesh. This study is introduced as a guidebook containing a comprehensive overview of the medical waste generation scenario, management techniques, Covid-19 impact from treatment to testing and vaccination, and the circular economy concept for sustainable waste management in Bangladesh. The estimated generation of medical waste in Bangladesh without considering the surge due to Covid-19 and other unusual medical emergencies would be approximately 50,000 tons (1.25 kg/bed/day) in 2025, out of which 12,435 tons were predicted to be hazardous waste. However, our calculation estimated that a total of 82,553, 168.4, and 2300 tons of medical waste was generated only from handling of Covid patients, test kits, and vaccination from March 2021 to May 2022. Applicability of existing guidelines, and legislation to handle the current situation and feasibility of LCA on medical waste management system to minimize environmental impact were scrutinized. Incineration with energy recovery and microwave sterilization were found to be the best treatment techniques with minimal environmental impact. A circular economy model with the concept of waste minimizaton, and value recovery was proposed for sustainable medical waste management. This study suggests proper training on healthcare waste management, proposing strict regulations, structured research allocation, and implementation of public-private partnerships to reduce, and control medical waste generation for creating a sustainable medical waste management system in Bangladesh. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bangladesh; Circular economy; Covid-19; Medical waste; Sustainable management","Animals; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Life Cycle Stages; Medical Waste; Waste Management; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Developing countries; Environmental impact; Hazards; Laws and legislation; Sustainable development; Vaccines; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Bangladesh; Circular economy; Covid-19; Healthcare waste management; Medical waste management; Medical wastes; Sustainable management; Sustainable waste management; Waste generation; Waste management systems; COVID-19; developing world; environmental economics; hazardous waste; life cycle analysis; waste management; Bangladesh; circular economy framework; conceptual framework; coronavirus disease 2019; data availability; economic aspect; emergency care; energy recovery; environmental law; environmental mitigation; environmental sustainability; feasibility study; health care policy; hospital waste; human; incineration; infectious waste; life cycle; life cycle assessment; mathematical computing; medical research; microwave sterilization; practice guideline; prediction; public-private partnership; Review; statistical model; vaccination; waste management; animal; Bangladesh; epidemiology; health care delivery; life cycle stage; procedures; waste management; Life cycle"

This review aims to identify and compare the different COVID-19 vaccine delivery strategies employed internationally in the recent year based on the economic evaluation findings and subsequently to recommend the most cost-effective strategy among them. Material and Methods: A systematic review was conducted by examining online databases (Scopus, MEDLINE and Science Direct) to identify health economic evaluation studies of COVID-19 vaccines. Critical appraisal of studies was conducted using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). Results: A total of nine studies were selected for analysis. Results show two strategies that were cost-effective compared to its comparators: mass vaccination program compared to no vaccination and universal vaccination approach compared to a risk-stratified vaccination approach. Several other strategies were found to increase the cost-consequences in the COVID-19 vaccination program: higher vaccine effectiveness, higher vaccination pace, increased vaccination coverage, and vaccine prioritisation for an at-risk population. The study findings were restricted to analysis based on the current available data. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination policies should aim for increased vaccine production as well as a rapid and extensive vaccine delivery system to ensure the maximal value of vaccination strategies. These results can aid policymakers in opting for the most efficient approach to vaccinating the population during this COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemic. © 2023, Malaysian Medical Association.

We aimed to assess the serological immune status of SARS-CoV-2 infection among these HWs. A prospective cohort study was initiated in the comprehensive cancer center of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region (NA, France). Volunteer HWs working on March 2020 without active infection or symptoms of COVID-19 completed a self-questionnaire and had a blood test at inclusion, at 3 and 12 months. Positive serological status of SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies and/or IgG anti-spike antibodies, except at 12 months due to vaccine. Half of the HWs were included (N = 517) and 89% were followed for three months (N = 500) and one year (N = 462). Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 3.5% (95% CI: 1.9–5.1), 6.2% (95% CI: 4.1–8.3), and 10% (95% CI: 7.2–12.7) on June–September 2020, September 2020–January 2021, and June–October 2021, respectively. At 12 months, 93.3% had detectable antibodies with 80% vaccinated in the first three months of vaccine availability. The COVID-19-free policy of the institution, respect for barrier gestures, high and early vaccination of HWs, and low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in NA may explain the low rate of seropositivity among the HWs of the Institut Bergonié. © 2023 by the authors.","antibody; anxiety; cancer center; COVID-19; health workers; SARS-CoV-2; seroprevalence; vaccination hesitancy",""

Understanding the reasons for the public’s negative opinions towards COVID-19 vaccination using Twitter may help make new headways in improving vaccine uptake. This study, therefore, examined the prevailing negative sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccination via the analysis of public twitter posts over a 16 month period. Original tweets (in English) from 1 April 2021 to 1 August 2022 were extracted. A bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based model was applied, and only negative sentiments tweets were selected. Topic modelling was used, followed by manual thematic analysis performed iteratively by the study investigators, with independent reviews of the topic labels and themes. A total of 4,448,314 tweets were analysed. The analysis generated six topics and three themes related to the prevailing negative sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccination. The themes could be broadly understood as either emotional reactions to perceived invidious policies or safety and effectiveness concerns related to the COVID-19 vaccines. The themes uncovered in the present infodemiology study fit well into the increasing vaccination model, and they highlight important public conversations to be had and potential avenues for future policy intervention and campaign efforts. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; machine learning; negative sentiment; sentiment analysis; vaccines","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; criticism of vaccine mandates and regulations; deep learning; emotion; emotional reaction; health care concepts; human; infodemiology; machine learning; natural language processing; negative sentiment; public opinion; risk of side effects; scepticism; sentiment analysis; social media; thematic analysis; unsupervised masked language model; unsupervised next sentence prediction; vaccination; vaccine effectiveness; virus strain"

However, the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among general people is questionable. The availability of several vaccines’ options against COVID-19 has perplexed people regarding individual vaccines’ efficacy and safety. Therefore, we aim to determine the acceptance, preferences, impact factors of future COVID-19 vaccines in Malaysia and the factors influencing the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among vaccine demand and vaccine delay groups. Material and methods: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among Malaysian residents 18 years and above of either gender using the snowball sampling technique. A self-administered questionnaire was made available to participants through various social media networks, email, and telegram. The data obtained from the survey were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Association between background characteristics and respondents were analyzed using the Chi-square test in the vaccine delay group and vaccine acceptance group. Results: Total of 1282 responses were considered for the study, mainly from male respondents (71%). Among the respondents, 95.9% thought that vaccination would be an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19, and 96% would accept vaccination if the COVID-19 vaccine were successfully developed and approved for listing in the future. Essential factors influencing vaccination decisions were vaccine convenience (95.7%) and doctor's recommendation (97.3%). Bivariate analysis revealed that age less than 24 years, Malay race, living in urban areas, tertiary education, students, single marital status, family income (Malaysian ringgits) RM 4,850 to RM 10,959 and >RM 10,960 were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance of COVID19 vaccination. Conclusion: All the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates throughout the country should be studied on a larger scale, and appropriate steps to ensure vaccine acceptance among the public should be meticulously devised by the government and related authorities. © 2021","COVID-19; Malaysia; South Asia; Vaccine acceptance; Vaccine hesitancy","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; attitude to health; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; decision making; employment status; family income; female; health care policy; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; Malaysian; male; marriage; public health; risk benefit analysis; secondary education; socioeconomic background; tertiary education; urban population; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy"

Methods: The value of booster vaccination in Indonesia is estimated by comparing simulated societal costs under a twelve-month, 187-million–dose Moderna booster vaccination campaign to costs without boosters. The costs of an epidemic and its mitigation consist of lost lives, economic closures and lost education; cost-minimising non-pharmaceutical mitigation is chosen for each scenario. Results: The cost-minimising non-pharmaceutical mitigation depends on the availability of vaccines: the differences between the two scenarios are 14 to 19 million years of in-person education and $153 to $204 billion in economic activity. The value of the booster campaign ranges from $2,500 ($1,400-$4,100) to $2,800 ($1,700-$4,600) per dose in the first year, depending on life-year valuations. Conclusions: The societal benefits of booster vaccination are substantial. Much of the value of vaccination resides in the reduced need for costly non-pharmaceutical mitigation. We propose cost minimisation as a tool for policy decision-making and valuation of vaccination, taking into account all socio-economic costs, and not averted deaths alone. © 2023 The Authors","COVID-19; Economics; Education; Non-pharmaceutical; Vaccination","Cost-Benefit Analysis; COVID-19; Humans; Indonesia; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cost minimization analysis; drug efficacy; female; health care access; health care cost; health care delivery; health care policy; health care system; health impact assessment; household; human; Indonesia; information processing; major clinical study; male; medical society; middle aged; mitigation; preschool child; revaccination; school child; socioeconomics; workplace; young adult; cost benefit analysis; epidemiology; Indonesia; prevention and control; vaccination"

Vaccine hesitancy is defined as ‘delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability’. Colonization is described as the ‘way the extractive economic system of capitalism came to the United States, supported by systems of supremacy and domination, which are a necessary part of keeping the wealth and power accumulated in the hands of the colonizers and ultimately their financiers’. The system of colonization results in policies and practices, including those related to health, that continue to create oppression and support racism. Persons experience trauma as the byproduct of colonization. Chronic stress and trauma create chronic inflammation and all diseases, whether genetic or lifestyle, have a common pathogenesis that is a component of inflammation. Medical mistrust is the absence of trust that healthcare providers and organizations genuinely care for patients' interests, are honest, practice confidentiality and have the competence to produce the best possible results. Finally, racism is described as everyday racism and perceived racism in healthcare. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","decolonization; racism; vaccine hesitancy","COVID-19; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Policy; Humans; Trust; United States; Vaccination Hesitancy; attitude to health; epidemiology; health care policy; human; prevention and control; trust; United States"

More information is needed on parental decision-making. We conducted a prospective cohort study from October 2021 to March 2022 among 334 parents in a large urban/suburban pediatric primary care network and linked longitudinal survey responses about attitudes and beliefs on vaccination, social norms, and access to vaccination services for COVID-19 to electronic health-record-derived vaccination outcomes for their eldest age-eligible children in June 2022. The odds of accepting two doses of COVID-19 vaccine for their child was higher in respondents who indicated the COVID-19 vaccine would be very safe (aOR [CI]: 2.69 [1.47–4.99], p = 0.001), as well as those who previously vaccinated their child against influenza (aOR [CI]: 4.07 [2.08–8.12], p < 0.001). The odds of vaccinating their child were lower for respondents who attended suburban vs. urban practices (aOR [CI]: 0.38 [0.21–0.67], p = 0.001). Parents in the cohort were active users of social media; the majority (78%) used their phone to check social media platforms at least once per day. Our findings suggest that healthcare providers and policymakers can focus on improving vaccination coverage among children living in suburban neighborhoods through targeted mobile-based messaging emphasizing safety to their parents. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19 vaccines; parental decision making; vaccination hesitancy","influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; anxiety; Article; attitude; behavior; cohort analysis; confidentiality; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; electronic health record; female; follow up; health behavior; health belief; health care personnel; health care policy; health insurance; hospitalization; human; immunization; influenza; influenza vaccination; innate immunity; Likert scale; loss of appetite; major clinical study; male; management; neighborhood; outcome assessment; pediatric hospital; primary medical care; prospective study; resident; social behavior; social media; social norm; training; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy"

We share experiences from Barcelona in measuring socioeconomic inequalities in the incidence of COVID-19 in the different waves, and in implementing coordinated and equity-oriented public health policy responses. Methods: We collected daily data on confirmed COVID-19 cases, geocoded the address of residence to assign each case to one of the 73 neighborhoods and 1068 census tracts, and calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 by neighborhood and five income groups (quintiles of census tracts) by sex across four waves of the pandemic. We adjusted hierarchical Bayesian spatial models to obtain the relative risk (RR) of cumulative incidences in each quintile compared with the richest areas. A variety of public health policies implemented to tackle the pandemic and especially these inequalities in COVID-19 incidence and vaccination are selected and described. Results: Area-level income inequalities in the incidence of COVID-19 were present at different degree in all four waves. In the second wave (10/1/2020 to 12/6/2020), RR for the poorest income quintile census tracts compared with the richest was 1.43 (95% credible interval-CI-: 1.22–1.67) for men and 1.58 (95% CI: 1.35–1.83) for women. Later, inequalities in vaccination coverage also arose. Equity-oriented policy responses included: “health hotels” or home delivery of basic products for individuals with COVID-19 and without adequate conditions for isolation; new emergency facilities for homeless people, including those with active drug use; mass screening in high incidence areas; contingency plans for nursing homes and schools; adapting community health programs for their early reactivation; digital self-appointment support points and community vaccination days. Conclusion: COVID-19 hit Barcelona neighborhoods unequally, with variations between waves. The rapid availability of geolocalized data and by socioeconomic level helped public authorities to implement targeted policies and collaborative interventions for the most vulnerable populations. Further studies would be needed to evaluate their impact. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Inequalities; Public policies; Urban areas","Bayes Theorem; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Socioeconomic Factors; Barcelona; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; COVID-19; disease incidence; equipment component; equity; health policy; integrated approach; neighborhood; policy analysis; policy approach; policy implementation; public health; socioeconomic conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; vaccination; adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; economic inequality; European; female; human; incidence; isolation; major clinical study; male; mass screening; nursing home; pandemic; public health; public policy; quarantine; risk factor; school; urban area; vaccination; Bayes theorem; incidence; policy; socioeconomics"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, NITAGs faced many challenges in making evidence-based recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines due to the rapidly evolving situation with new vaccine products available in a short time period and limited data on vaccine effectiveness. The authors reviewed the process used by Serbia's NITAG, which is called the Serbian Expert Committee on Immunization, to develop COVID-19 vaccine recommendations during the pandemic. The article examines the challenges and successes faced by the committee. Serbia's expert committee used the best available evidence to develop over forty recommendations on all aspects of COVID-19 vaccination. These expert committee recommendations facilitated the early procurement and successful roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, guidance for vaccination of individuals at the highest risk, and high COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the country. The availability of five COVID-19 vaccines in Serbia was an advantage for the successful roll-out but posed challenges for the expert committee.

This represents a missed opportunity for monitoring and identifying gender-responsive, evidence-informed solutions to address a key driver of the pandemic. In this paper we review the availability of national sex-disaggregated surveillance data on COVID-19 and examine trends on the testing-to-outcome pathway. We further analyse the availability of data according to the economic status of the country and investigate the determinants of sex differences, including the national gender inequality status (according to a global index) in each country. Results are drawn from 18 months of global data collection from over 200 countries. We find differences in COVID-19 prevention behaviours and illness outcomes by sex, with lower uptake of vaccination and testing plus an elevated risk of severe disease and death among men. Supporting and maintaining the collection, collation, interpretation and presentation of sex-disaggregated data requires commitment and resources at subnational, national and global levels, but provides an opportunity for identifying and taking gender-responsive action on health inequities. As a first step the global health community should recognise, value and support the importance of sex-disaggregated data for identifying and tackling an inequitable pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Gender inequality; Health inequity; Sex-disaggregated data",""

Papua New Guinea (PNG) has remained on high alert ever since, and its National Control Centre continues to coordinate national preparedness and response measures, guided by its Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19. As part of the WHO and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization's COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) program, PNG received several shipments of COVID-19 vaccine doses. A nationwide vaccine rollout for COVID-19 was initiated in PNG in May 2021. Despite the availability of vaccines and the capacity of health systems to vaccinate frontline workers and community members, including high-risk groups, there are still critical issues related to vaccine safety, confidence, and acceptance to ensure the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Evidence from studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and demand in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) suggests that sociocultural characteristics of the community and the behaviors of different vaccine stakeholders, including vaccine recipients, vaccine providers, and policymakers, determine the effectiveness of vaccination interventions or strategies. Objective: This study will examine sociocultural determinants of anticipated acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in urban and rural areas of different regions in PNG and health care providers’ views on vaccine acceptance. Methods: The study design uses a mixed methods approach in PNG’s coastal and highlands regions. The first research activity will use a qualitative methodology with an epistemological foundation based on constructivism. This design elicits and listens to community members’ accounts of ways culture is a rich resource that provides meaning to the COVID-19 pandemic; the design also measures adherence to niupela pasin (“new normal” in Tok Pidgin) and vaccination acceptance. The second activity will be a cross-sectional survey to assess the distribution of features of vaccine acceptance, priorities, and practices. The third activity will be in-depth interviews of health care providers actively involved in either COVID-19 clinical management or public health–related pandemic control activities. Results: The project proposal has been reviewed and approved by the Medical Research Advisory Committee of Papua New Guinea. Qualitative data collection started in December 2022, and the survey will begin in May 2023. The findings will be disseminated to the participating communities later this year, followed by publication. Conclusions: The proposed research on community views and experiences concerning sociocultural and behavioral features of acceptance of the vaccine will provide a better understanding of communication and education needs for vaccine action for COVID-19 control in PNG and other LMICs. The research also considers the influence of health care providers’ and policy makers’ roles in the awareness and use of the COVID-19 vaccine. © Joseph Gnanouday Giduthuri, Clement Manineng, Elisabeth Schuele.

As per the World Health Organization, vaccine hesitancy is one of the top 10 hazards to global health. Vaccine hesitancy varies across countries, with India reporting the least vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy was higher toward COVID-19 booster doses than previous shots. Therefore, identifying factors determining COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitance (VBH) is the sine qua non of a successful vaccination campaign. Methodology: This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020 standards. A total of 982 articles were pooled from Scopus, PubMed and Embase, while 42 articles that addressed the factors of COVID-19 VBH were finally included for further analysis. Result: We identified factors responsible for VBH and divided them into three major groups: sociodemographic, financial, and psychological. Hence, 17 articles stated age to be a major factor for vaccine hesitancy, with most reports suggesting a negative correlation between age and fear of poor vaccination outcomes. Nine studies found females expressing greater vaccine hesitancy than males. Trust deficit in science (n = 14), concerns about safety and efficacy (n = 12), lower levels of fear regarding infection (n = 11), and worry about side effects (n = 8) were also reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Blacks, Democrats, and pregnant women showed high vaccine hesitancy. Few studies have stated income, obesity, social media, and the population living with vulnerable members as factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. A study in India showed that 44.1% of vaccine hesitancy towards booster doses could be attributed dominantly to low income, rural origin, previously unvaccinated status, or living with vulnerable individuals. However, two other Indian studies reported a lack of availability of vaccination slots, a lack of trust in the government, and concerns regarding safety as factors for vaccine hesitancy toward booster doses. Conclusion: Many studies have confirmed the multifactorial nature of VBH, which necessitates multifaceted, individually tailored interventions that address all potentially modifiable factors. This systematic review chiefly recommends strategizing the campaign for booster doses by identifying and evaluating the reasons for vaccine hesitancy, followed by appropriate communication (at both individual and community levels) about the benefits of booster doses and the risk of losing immunity without them. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19 booster dose; hesitancy factors; reluctance among adults; vaccine booster hesitance(VBH)","bnt 162 b 2; elasomeran; ibacovavec; tozinameran; vaxzevria; body weight gain; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; economic aspect; employment status; human; infection risk; innate immunity; lifestyle; psychological aspect; public policy; Review; social media; sociodemographics; socioeconomics; systematic review; tertiary education; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; virus mutation"

There is paucity of data about vaccine acceptance and factors influencing parents' hesitancy about the COVID-19 vaccine for young children. Aims and objectives To estimate vaccine acceptance by parents of children 6 months through 4 years, and to evaluate the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Methods Electronic survey was sent to parents of children 6 months through 4 years through an online portal account at Mayo Clinic Health System, Northwest-Wisconsin. Data were captured via Research Electronic Data Capture secured data collection software. Bivariate and multivariate regression was used to determine most pertinent factors influencing parents' decisions against the outcome, € Intent to Vaccinate'. Results 39.7% of the parents were € very likely' or € somewhat likely' to vaccinate their children once the vaccine became available, while 49.8% were not likely or highly unlikely to vaccinate. Routine childhood vaccination, receiving seasonal influenza vaccine, parents' perception of COVID-19 severity in children and safety and effectiveness of the vaccine were all associated with more vaccine acceptance. 71.4% of parents who will likely not vaccinate their children indicated that they are unlikely to change their decision. The need for more research on the vaccine and more information from the PCP office were the most common reasons behind the vaccine decision-making. Conclusions Vaccine hesitancy remains a major issue regarding uptake of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. Strong and clear evidence-based recommendations from primary care provider and more information from trusted websites such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can decrease vaccine hesitancy in parents. Further research targeted at understanding beliefs and perspectives of parents from different demographics can assist policy-makers in implementing measures to improve vaccination rates in children and tailor our dialogue to match the needs of our patients and families.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

While vaccination’s role as a powerful life-saving weapon in the fight against infectious diseases has been further highlighted following the introduction of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, there is still a discrepancy between the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of vaccines and the perception of the risk attributed to them. Known as “Vaccine Hesitancy” (VH), this phenomenon is the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines, despite the availability of services. VH can be found in at least 15% of the worldwide population, and even professional groups tasked with promoting vaccination as a primary prevention measure, e.g., healthcare workers (HCWs), sometimes have doubts regarding vaccination. Since 2014, this Public Health problem has been increasing in 90% of countries worldwide, to the extent that in 2019 it was listed as one of the ten greatest threats to global health by the World Health Organization (WHO). VH has also affected COVID-19 vaccination, hampering the achievement of desired vaccination coverage. Monitoring this trend by studying people’s behaviour and attitudes could be a useful tool to aid Public Health, in orienting vaccination policies and designing new health education and continuous training interventions, aimed at both the general public and accountable cohorts, such as HCWs. © 2022 by the authors.

The current study aimed to identify the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of vaccine hesitancy and resistance among young adults (18–40 years) during the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy, the first country after China being hit by the pandemic and which suffered a large number of fatalities. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, web-based study conducted in Italy using an ISO-certified international survey company (respondi.com). Data were collected on 1200 participants in June 2021. Results: Vaccine hesitancy/resistance was found for 25% of the sample. In multinomial logistic regression (N = 1159), being aged 30–40 years, residing in northern Italy, having lower educational and income level, being unemployed, and not knowing any friends/relatives diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of hesitancy or resistance. In multivariate analysis of variance (N = 1177), both vaccine hesitant and resistant young adults perceived significantly less social support from friends and family than vaccine accepting ones. Resistant individuals reported significantly higher levels of conspiracy theories and negative attitudes toward vaccines than their accepting and hesitant counterparts. Moreover, resistant individuals reported significantly lower levels of attachment to country and perceptions of a just government compared to accepting ones, with hesitant young adults scoring in between. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that young adults with a hesitant (vs. resistant) attitude show a more nuanced and less extreme psychological profile. Public health messaging should capitalize on social media to provide accessible, transparent, and age-appropriate information concerning COVID-19 vaccine safety. Moreover, policy efforts improving the availability of social support systems are warranted to strengthen connectedness and foster trust in institutions amongst this particular segment of the population. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Italy; Psychological correlates; Vaccine hesitancy; Young adults","Adult; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccination Hesitancy; Young Adult; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; age; Article; attitude to health; conspiracy theory; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; educational status; family; female; friend; government; human; income; Italy; major clinical study; male; psychological aspect; residential area; social support; sociodemographics; unemployment; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; aged; epidemiology; prevention and control; vaccination; young adult"

This study examined COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among health care workers (HCWs) in Thailand before and after vaccines' availability and investigated factors (both enablers and barriers) affecting their decisions. Methods: Two online self-administered questionnaires were distributed to HCWs in two time-periods: (1) the pre-vaccine arrival period (prior to COVID-19 vaccines' arrival in Thailand, January 28 to February 16, 2021); and (2) the post-vaccine arrival period (April 21 to May 9, 2021). Descriptive analyses and multinomial logistic regression were conducted to examine factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Results: There were 55,068 respondents in the pre-vaccine arrival period and 27,319 respondents in the post-vaccine arrival period. In the pre-vaccine arrival period, 55.0% of respondents were willing to accept the vaccines, 35.4% were uncertain, and 9.6% declined. In the post-vaccine arrival period, ~16% already received two doses of either the Sinovac or AstraZeneca vaccine, and 43% were administered one dose. Approximately 12% of those who had received the first dose were uncertain or not willing to accept the second dose. Demographic and socio-demographic factors of participants, including their sex, place of residence, and whether they were frontline COVID-19 workers, were found to be the significant factors explaining vaccination hesitancy. Moreover, when comparing the pre-vaccine arrival and post-vaccine arrival periods, it was found that older HCWs were more likely to decline a COVID-19 vaccine in the pre-vaccine arrival period; on the other hand, older HCWs were less likely to decline or be uncertain to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the post-vaccine arrival period. Conclusion: Information on HCWs' acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, including who is more likely to accept the vaccines, could assist in planning vaccine allocation to both HCWs and the general public, who often believe HCWs' recommendations. This study's findings set out how policies can be addressed to reduce vaccine hesitancy. This study also highlights HCWs' characteristics (including gender, work region, occupation, and history of receiving influenza vaccination) and the reasons they cited for their vaccine acceptance or hesitance.

In order to explain the discrepancy between availability and population uptake, a case study was conducted analyzing vaccine rollout plans, social media, and Health Officer/Other Key Informant interviews in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Key research questions included, “What were the barriers and facilitators of early COVID vaccine distribution?” and “What mechanisms in the community emerged to alleviate strains in early vaccination?” Findings from this study revealed that pre-existing emergency preparedness infrastructures and plans developed since the 9/11 tragedy were seemingly abandoned. This caused health departments at all levels of government to make impromptu, non-uniform decisions leading to confusion, vaccine hesitancy, and ultimately low uptake.

The efficacy of the vaccines vary depending on the SARS-CoV-2 variant. Some countries have been able to deploy strong vaccination programs, and large proportions of their populations have been fully vaccinated. In other countries, low proportions of their populations have been vaccinated, due to different factors. For instance, countries such as Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ghana, Haiti and Syria have less than 10% of their populations fully vaccinated at this time. Implementing an optimal vaccination program is a very complex process due to a variety of variables that affect the programs. Besides, science, policy and ethics are all involved in the determination of the main objectives of the vaccination program. We present two nonlinear mathematical models that allow us to gain insight into the optimal vaccination strategy under different situations, taking into account the case fatality rate and age-structure of the population. We study scenarios with different availabilities and efficacies of the vaccines. The results of this study show that for most scenarios, the optimal allocation of vaccines is to first give the doses to people in the 55+ age group. However, in some situations the optimal strategy is to first allocate vaccines to the 15–54 age group. This situation occurs whenever the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate is relatively high and the people in the 55+ age group have a transmission rate 50% or less that of those in the 15–54 age group. This study and similar ones can provide scientific recommendations for countries where the proportion of vaccinated individuals is relatively small or for future pandemics. © 2022 by the authors.

To control the pandemic, a sufficient proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated promptly. Despite the proven efficacy and widespread availability, vaccine distribution and administration rates remain low. Thus, it is important to understand the public behavior of COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to identify determinants at multiple levels that promote or inhibit one's vaccine uptake. We combine individual-level data from a national survey conducted in the summer of 2021 with corresponding state-level indicators. Findings of multilevel logistic regression show that political orientation, social network, and economic recovery altogether have significant influence. We articulate that individual decision to take the vaccine are a function of their personal characteristics and are also rooted in their home state's political, public health, and economic contexts. These findings contribute to the literature and have policy implications.

Vaccination rates have differed between countries, depending on supply (availability of resources) and demand (altruism and resistance to vaccination) factors. Methods: This work considers the hypothesis that individuals’ health altruism has been an important factor to explain the different levels of vaccination between countries, using the number of transplants as a proxy for altruism. Taking European Union’s countries to remove, as far as possible, supply factors that might affect vaccination, we carry out cross-sectional regressions for the most favorable date of the vaccination process (maximum vaccination speed) and for each month during the vaccination campaign. Results: Our findings confirm that altruism has affected vaccination rates against the COVID-19. We find a direct relationship between transplants rates (proxy variable) and vaccination rates during periods in which the decision to be vaccinated depended on the individual’s choice, without supply restrictions. The results show that other demand factors have worked against vaccination: political polarization and belonging to the group of countries of the former Eastern bloc. Conclusions: Altruism is a useful tool to define future vaccination strategies, since it favors the individuals’ awareness for vaccination. © 2022, The Author(s).","Altruism; COVID-19; hesitancy; Externality; Herd immunity; Public health; Vaccines","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; altruism; Article; awareness; behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; health care organization; health care policy; health promotion; herd immunity; mass immunization; polarization; population size; public health; scientific literature; socioeconomics; transplantation; vaccination; velocity"

COVAX positioned itself as a global vaccine-sharing hub that promised to share doses “equitably, effectively and transparently,” according to rational criteria overseen by independent scientists. This article provides a critical analysis of the principles and practice of “dose-sharing,” showing how it reveals the politics at play within COVAX. Results: Donated doses were an important source of COVAX’s vaccine supply in 2021, accounting for 60% of the doses the initiative delivered (543 million out of 910 million). However, donations could not compensate fully for COVAX’s persistent procurement struggles: it delivered less than half of the two billion doses it originally projected for 2021, a fraction of the 9.25 billion doses that were administered globally in 2021. Donor countries and vaccine manufacturers systematically broke COVAX’s principles for maximizing the impact of dose-sharing, delivering doses late, in smaller quantities than promised, and in ad hoc ways that made roll-out in recipient countries difficult. Some donors even earmarked doses for specific recipients, complicating and potentially undermining COVAX’s equitable allocation mechanism. Conclusions: COVAX’s pivot from global vaccine procurement mechanism to dose-sharing hub can be seen as a “win-win-win” solution for COVAX itself (who could claim success by having access to more doses), for donor countries (who could rebrand themselves as charitable donors rather than “vaccine hoarders”), and for the pharmaceutical industry (maintaining the status quo on intellectual property rights and protecting their commercial interests). Although dose-sharing helped COVAX’s vaccine delivery, its impact was undermined by donors’ and industry’s pursuit of national security, diplomatic and commercial interests, which COVAX largely accommodated. The lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms within COVAX’s overly complex governance structure as a global public-private partnership enabled these practices. © 2022, The Author(s).","Covid-19; Diplomacy; Donation; Equity; Foreign policy; Global health; Public-private partnership; Vaccine","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Global Health; Humans; Politics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; aid flow; COVID-19; developing world; foreign policy; pharmaceutical industry; politics; public-private partnership; vaccine; Article; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; drug industry; drug marketing; global health; health care access; health care availability; health care delivery; health care disparity; human; medical society; national security; politics; public-private partnership; vaccination; politics; prevention and control"

However, further research is needed to systematically investigate the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy in the literature. To bridge the research gap, this study examines the zero-COVID-19 strategy in terms of its advantages as a global anti-pandemic framework. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus to locate academic articles that discussed the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy. Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis approach was adopted to guide the data analysis process. Results: The findings of our study show that the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy range from short-term (e.g., limited virus infections, hospitalizations, and deaths), to medium-term (e.g., reduced presence of other infectious diseases), and long-term (e.g., low incidence of long COVID-19). While local residents mainly leverage these advantages, they also impact the global community (e.g., stable global supply of essentials, such as COVID-19 vaccines). Conclusions: COVID-19 is catastrophic, yet controllable. Our study examined the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy from a nuanced perspective and discussed how these advantages benefit both the local and the global community in pandemic control and management. Future studies could investigate the shortcomings of the zero-COVID-19 strategy, especially its unintended consequences, such as adverse impacts on vulnerable populations’ mental health, so that society could more efficiently, economically, and empathetically capitalize on the potential of the zero-COVID-19 strategy for the betterment of personal and public health. © 2022 by the authors.","coronavirus; COVID-19; public health policies; virus elimination; zero-COVID-19 strategy","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; COVID-19; disease control; health policy; public health; strategic approach; viral disease; adverse outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; economic aspect; health care availability; health care delivery; health care policy; hospitalization; human; incidence; infection prevention; mental health; mortality rate; pandemic; public health; Review; thematic analysis; vaccination; vulnerable population; complication; epidemiology; pandemic; prevention and control"

Intensive research has been carried out on several aspects of COVID-19, including vaccines, its transmission mechanism, detection of COVID-19 infection, and its infection rate and factors. The awareness of the public related to the COVID-19 infection factors enables the public to adhere to the standard operating procedures, while a full elucidation on the correlation of different factors to the infection rate facilitates effective measures to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection by policy makers and enforcers. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive and analytical review of different factors affecting the COVID-19 infection rate. Furthermore, this review analyses factors which directly and indirectly affect the COVID-19 infection risk, such as physical distance, ventilation, face masks, meteorological factor, socioeconomic factor, vaccination, host factor, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the availability of COVID-19 testing. Critical analysis was performed for the different factors by providing quantitative and qualitative studies.

In order to eradicate the disease, a great help came from unprecedentedly fast vaccines development along with strict preventive measures adoption like lockdown. Thus, world wide provisioning of vaccines was crucial in order to achieve the maximum immunization of population. However, the fast development of vaccines, driven by the urge of limiting the pandemic caused skeptical reactions by a vast amount of population. More specifically, the people’s hesitancy in getting vaccinated was an additional obstacle in fighting COVID-19. To ameliorate this scenario, it is important to understand people’s sentiments about vaccines in order to take proper actions to better inform the population. As a matter of fact, people continuously update their feelings and sentiments on social media, thus a proper analysis of those opinions is an important challenge for providing proper information to avoid misinformation. More in detail, sentiment analysis (Wankhade et al. in Artif Intell Rev 55(7):5731–5780, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-022-10144-1) is a powerful technique in natural language processing that enables the identification and classification of people feelings (mainly) in text data. It involves the use of machine learning algorithms and other computational techniques to analyze large volumes of text and determine whether they express positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis is widely used in industries such as marketing, customer service, and healthcare, among others, to gain actionable insights from customer feedback, social media posts, and other forms of unstructured textual data. In this paper, Sentiment Analysis will be used to elaborate on people reaction to COVID-19 vaccines in order to provide useful insights to improve the correct understanding of their correct usage and possible advantages. In this paper, a framework that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods is proposed for classifying tweets based on their polarity values. We analyzed Twitter data related to COVID-19 vaccines after the most appropriate pre-processing on them. More specifically, we identified the word-cloud of negative, positive, and neutral words using an artificial intelligence tool to determine the sentiment of tweets. After this pre-processing step, we performed classification using the BERT + NBSVM model to classify people’s sentiments about vaccines. The reason for choosing to combine bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and Naive Bayes and support vector machine (NBSVM) can be understood by considering the limitation of BERT-based approaches, which only leverage encoder layers, resulting in lower performance on short texts like the ones used in our analysis. Such a limitation can be ameliorated by using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine approaches that are able to achieve higher performance in short text sentiment analysis. Thus, we took advantage of both BERT features and NBSVM features to define a flexible framework for our sentiment analysis goal related to vaccine sentiment identification. Moreover, we enrich our results with spatial analysis of the data by using geo-coding, visualization, and spatial correlation analysis to suggest the most suitable vaccination centers to users based on the sentiment analysis outcomes. In principle, we do not need to implement a distributed architecture to run our experiments as the available public data are not massive. However, we discuss a high-performance architecture that will be used if the collected data scales up dramatically. We compared our approach with the state-of-art methods by comparing most widely used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure. The proposed BERT + NBSVM outperformed alternative models by achieving 73% accuracy, 71% precision, 88% recall and 73% F-measure for classification of positive sentiments while 73% accuracy, 71% precision, 74% recall and 73% F-measure for classification of negative sentiments respectively. These promising results will be properly discussed in next sections. The use of artificial intelligence methods and social media analysis can lead to a better understanding of people’s reactions and opinions about any trending topic. However, in the case of health-related topics like COVID-19 vaccines, proper sentiment identification could be crucial for implementing public health policies. More in detail, the availability of useful findings on user opinions about vaccines can help policymakers design proper strategies and implement ad-hoc vaccination protocols according to people’s feelings, in order to provide better public service. To this end, we leveraged geospatial information to support effective recommendations for vaccination centers. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; BERT; BERT + NBSVM; Buffering; COVID vaccines; NBSVM; Sentiment analysis; Spatial analysis; Vaccine hesitancy","COVID-19; Learning algorithms; Social networking (online); Spatial variables measurement; Support vector machines; Vaccines; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer + naive baye and support vector machine; Buffering; COVID vaccine; Naive baye and support vector machine; Naive bayes; Sentiment analysis; Spatial analysis; Support vectors machine; Vaccine hesitancy; Sentiment analysis"

However, vaccination rates among this population remain low. While syringe services programs (SSPs) are places where persons who inject drugs feel comfortable accessing services, few offer vaccination services. This study describes facilitators and barriers to vaccination at SSPs. Methods: We used convenience sampling to conduct semi-structured, qualitative in-depth interviews with 21 SSPs in the USA from June to August 2021. Interview questions asked SSPs about their perceptions, priorities, barriers, facilitators, and the effects of partnerships and policies on vaccine administration. We used deductive thematic analysis to identify the main themes. Results: Eight (n = 8) SSPs offered vaccinations, and thirteen (n = 13) did not offer vaccinations. Most SSPs believed offering vaccination services was important, although addressing SSP participants’ immediate needs often took precedence. Staffing, physical space, and logistical issues were the most common barriers to vaccine administration reported by SSPs, followed by SSP participant-related barriers. Facilitators of vaccine administration included access to a tracking system, partnering with agencies or other organizations providing vaccines, and having a licensed vaccination provider on-site. Partnerships provided SSPs opportunities to expand capacity but could also restrict how SSPs operate. Recommended policy changes to facilitate vaccine administration included subsidizing the cost of vaccinations and addressing restrictions around who could administer vaccinations. Conclusions: Increasing the availability of vaccination services at SSPs requires addressing the varying capacity needs of SSPs, such as tracking systems, licensed vaccinators, and free or low-cost vaccination supplies. While these needs can be met through partnerships and supportive policies, both must consider and reflect cultural competence around the lived experiences of persons who inject drugs. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Drug users; Hepatitis A; Hepatitis B; Needle exchange programs; Vaccination","Drug Users; Humans; Needle-Exchange Programs; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Syringes; Vaccination; Vaccines; vaccine; Article; attitude; community program; cooperation; cultural competence; drug cost; health care access; health care personnel; organization; organizational capacity; organizational policy; personal experience; public health service; qualitative research; semi structured interview; social support; syringe service program; United States; vaccination; drug use; epidemiology; human; preventive health service; substance abuse; syringe; vaccination"

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous pressure on healthcare systems, affecting resilience of the overall vaccine ecosystem. Methods: This article reviews how vaccine budgets are structured across 8 European countries (England, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Romania, and Spain). First a literature review of the landscape was undertaken, followed by expert interviews to review the findings and consider policy principles to secure prioritisation and sustainability of routine vaccination budgets post-COVID. Results: The organisation of budgets and vaccine spending varies greatly across Europe. In 2/8 countries (France and Germany) vaccine spending is subsumed into a wider healthcare budget. In 2/8 countries (Italy and Romania) the budget differentiates public health and prevention spending from other areas of healthcare, though there is no standalone vaccine budget. In 4/8 countries (England, Finland, Norway and Spain) there is a standalone vaccine budget, however this may not cover all elements needed for immunisation delivery and is not always transparent. Conclusion: Ensuring adequate and dynamic country vaccine budgets, with horizon scanning approaches like in England and Finland, or flexible vaccines expenditures like Germany, would greatly help the timely availability of public funding for new vaccines and strengthen vaccines supply security in Europe through a more virtuous European vaccine ecosystem. © 2022","Europe; Patient access; Routine vaccination; Vaccine budgets; Vaccine funding","COVID-19; Ecosystem; Europe; Humans; Pandemics; Vaccines; vaccine; ecosystem; Europe; human; pandemic; prevention and control"

In the present study, we explore, from the perspective of owners and company leadership, the barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing among U.S. companies. Key informant interviews with company representatives were conducted during January–April 2021 about SARS-CoV-2 testing. A pre-interview survey assessed respondent socio-demographic and organizational characteristics. Interview sessions were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using MaxQDA. A total of twenty interviews were completed with at least two interviews conducted in each major U.S. industry sector. Ninety percent of participants represented companies in business >10 years, comprising both small and large workforces. Using a grounded theory approach, six themes emerged: (1) access to and knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 tests; (2) strategies for symptomatic and asymptomatic testing of workers; (3) type/availability of personal protective equipment to mitigate coronavirus exposures; (4) return-to-work policies; (5) guidance and communication of SARS-CoV-2 Testing; and (6) use of contact tracing and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Fiscal health modelling (FHM) has recently been brought forward as an additional analysis by defining the public economic impact from a governmental perspective. As governments are the main decision-makers concerning pandemic preparedness, this study aimed to develop an FHM framework for infectious diseases in the Netherlands. Based on the Dutch COVID-19 outbreak of 2020 and 2021 and publicly available data on tax income and gross domestic product (GDP), the fiscal impact of COVID-19 was assessed using two approaches. Approach I: Prospective modelling of future fiscal impact based on publicly available laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases; and Approach II: Retrospective assessment of the extrapolated tax and benefit income and GDP. Approach I estimated the consequences that can be causally linked to the population counts reducing income taxes by EUR 266 million. The total fiscal loss amounted to EUR 164 million over 2 years (excluding pension payments averted). The total losses in terms of tax income (2020 and 2021) and GDP (2020) (Approach II), were estimated at, respectively, EUR 13.58 billion and EUR 96.3 billion. This study analysed different aspects of a communicable disease outbreak and its influence on government public accounts. The choice of the two presented approaches depends on the perspective of the analysis, the time horizon of the analysis and the availability of data. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; fiscal health modelling; governmental perspective; infectious disease; social benefits; tax revenue","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; biomedical technology assessment; child; communicable disease; conceptual framework; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; disease simulation; economic aspect; fiscal health modelling; government; gross national product; health care cost; health care policy; health economics; health insurance; human; income; inheritance tax; intensive care unit; lockdown; middle aged; morbidity; mortality; mortality rate; Netherlands; pandemic; payment; pension; public finance; public health; retrospective study; tax; tax revenue; vaccination; value added tax"

Migration likewise affects hundreds of millions of people annually, many of whom are women and children, and increases risks for poor vaccine completion and mother to child transmission of hepatitis B. In the neighbouring countries of Thailand and Myanmar, vaccine campaigns have made progress but little is known about the reach of these programs into migrant worker communities from Myanmar living in Thailand. Methods: A cohort of 253 postpartum women (53 urban migrants in Chiang Mai and 200 rural migrants in Tak Province) were surveyed about their Hepatitis B knowledge and willingness to vaccinate their children between September 10, 2019 and March 30, 2019. They were subsequently followed to determine vaccine completion. When records of vaccination were unavailable at the birth facility, or visits were late, families were contacted and interviewed about vaccination elsewhere, and reasons for late or missed vaccines. Results: Though women in Tak province displayed better knowledge of Hepatitis B and equal intention to vaccinate, they were 14 times less likely to complete Hepatitis B vaccination for their children compared to migrants in Chiang Mai. Tak women were largely undocumented, had private (non-profit) insurance and had more transient residence. In Chiang Mai migrant women were mostly documented and had full access to the Thai national health services. Though minor individual and facility-level differences may have contributed, the major driver of the disparity seems to be the place of migrants within local socio-political-economic systems. The COVID-19 pandemic further disproportionately affected Tak province migrants who faced severe travel restrictions hampering vaccination. Sixty percent of families who were lost to vaccine follow-up in Tak province could not be contacted by phone or home visit. Chiang Mai migrants, with 86.8% vaccine completion, nearly reached the target of 90%. Conclusions: Achievement of high levels of hepatitis B vaccination in migrant communities is important and feasible, and requires inclusive policies that integrate migrants into national health and social services. This is more urgent than ever during the COVID-19 era. © 2022, The Author(s).","Chiang Mai; Documentation; EPI; Health services; Immunization; Mae Sot; Migration; Myanmar; Tak","Child; COVID-19; Female; Hepatitis B; Humans; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; Thailand; Transients and Migrants; Vaccination; Vaccines; Chiang Mai [Northern Region]; Tak; hepatitis B vaccine; vaccine; COVID-19; health services; hepatitis; immunization; migrant worker; migration; vaccination; adult; Article; attitude to health; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; documentation; family; female; follow up; health disparity; health program; health service; health survey; hepatitis B; home visit; human; immunization; infant; interview; medical record; medication compliance; migrant worker; Myanmar; pandemic; patient compliance; politics; prospective study; puerperium; socioeconomics; Thailand; travel restriction; vaccination; young adult; child; epidemiology; hepatitis B; male; migration; pandemic; prevention and control; Thailand; vaccination; vertical transmission"

Study design: We conduct exploratory analyses of social patterns that uphold vaccination success for COVID-19 and measles. Methods: We use publicly available data on COVID vaccination rates and other country-level indicators from Our World in Data, Human Development Report, Corruption Perception Index, and the World Bank to devise bivariate correlations and multiple regression models. Results: About 70% of the variability in COVID-19 vaccination rates in February 2022 can be explained by differences in the Human Development Index (HDI) and, specifically, in life expectancy at birth. Trust in doctors and nurses adds predictive value beyond HDI, clarifying controversial discrepancies between vaccination rates in countries with similar levels of HDI and vaccine availability. Cardiovascular disease deaths, an indicator of general health system effectiveness, and infant measles immunization coverage, an indicator of country-level immunization effectiveness, are also significant, though weaker, predictors of COVID-19 vaccination success. Measles vaccination in 2019 is similarly predicted by HDI and trust in doctors and nurses. Conclusions: The remaining variability in COVID-19 vaccination success that cannot be pinned down through these sets of metrics points to a considerable scope for collective and individual agency in a time of crisis. The mobilization and coordination in the vaccination campaigns of citizens, medical professionals, scientists, journalists, and politicians, among others, account for at least some of this variability in overcoming vaccine hesitancy and inequity. © 2022 The Royal Society for Public Health","COVID-19; Human Development Index; Life expectancy; Measles; Trust; Vaccination","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Measles; Measles Vaccine; Trust; Vaccination; measles vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; measles vaccine; cardiovascular disease; correlation; corruption; COVID-19; disease control; global perspective; health worker; human development index; life expectancy; measles; mortality; perception; public health; social behavior; vaccination; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; corruption; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; economic inequality; exploratory research; health care access; health care availability; health care cost; health care policy; human; infant; life expectancy; lockdown; measles; poverty; predictive value; prevalence; risk factor; social capital; social distancing; trust; vaccination; life expectancy; measles; newborn; prevention and control; trust; vaccination"

Determining characteristics of groups defined by mitigation behaviors compliance may be useful to inform targeted public health policies and interventions. This study aimed to identify groups of individuals according to self-reported compliance with COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, define compliance class characteristics, and explore associations between compliance classes and important study and public health outcomes. Methods and findings We studied 1,410 participants in the Cabarrus County COVID-19 Prevalence and Immunity longitudinal cohort study (June 2020 to December 2021) who were asked 10 questions regarding compliance with recommended COVID-19 mitigation behaviors. By Latent Class Analysis, 1,381 participants were categorized into 3 classes (most [49.4%], moderately [45.0%], and least [5.6%] compliant). Compared with the most compliant class, the least and moderately compliant classes were younger (mean = 61.9 v. 59.0 v. 53.8 years), had fewer medical conditions per individual (1.37 v. 1.08 v. 0.77), and differed in Hispanic ethnicity (6.2% v. 2.8% v. 9.1%) and COVID-19 vaccine intention (65.8% v. 59.8% v. 35.1%). Compared to the most compliant class, the least compliant class had fewer women (54.6% v. 76.3%), fewer insured individuals (92.2% v. 97.4%), and more withdrew from study participation early (28.6% v. 16.0%). Relative to the most compliant class, the least compliant class had a higher likelihood of COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.08 [95% CI 1.13, 3.85]), lower rate of COVID-19 vaccination (72.6% v. 95.1%), and longer time to 50% COVID-19 vaccination following eligibility (8-9 vs 16 days). Conclusions Classes defined by mitigation behaviors compliance had distinct characteristics, including age, sex, medical history, and ethnicity, and were associated with important study and public health outcomes. Targeted public health policies and interventions according to the compliance group characteristics may be of value in current and future pandemic responses to increase compliance.  © 2023 Neighbors et al.

Vaccination is effective, but access differs around the world. We aimed to ascertain the availability, readiness and prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccines for this group of patients globally. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Collaborators from the International Society of Nephrology (ISN), Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study and ISN-Global Kidney Health Atlas developed an online survey that was administered electronically to key nephrology leaders in 174 countries between 2 July and 4 August 2021. RESULTS: Survey responses were received from 99 of 174 countries from all 10 ISN regions, among which 88/174 (50%) were complete. At least one vaccine was available in 96/99 (97%) countries. In 71% of the countries surveyed, patients on dialysis were prioritised for vaccination, followed by patients living with a kidney transplant (KT) (62%) and stage 4/5 CKD (51%). Healthcare workers were the most common high priority group for vaccination. At least 50% of patients receiving in-centre haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or KT were estimated to have completed vaccination at the time of the survey in 55%, 64% and 51% of countries, respectively. At least 50% of patients in all three patient groups had been vaccinated in >70% of high-income countries and in 100% of respondent countries in Western Europe.The most common barriers to vaccination of patients were vaccine hesitancy (74%), vaccine shortages (61%) and mass vaccine distribution challenges (48%). These were reported more in low-income and lower middle-income countries compared with high-income countries. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced CKD or KFRT were prioritised in COVID-19 vaccination in most countries. Multiple barriers led to substantial variability in the successful achievement of COVID-19 vaccination across the world, with high-income countries achieving the most access and success. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Aim: The study aims to understand the vulnerabilities to which it subjected the pharmaceutical product distribution supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic and further develop an adaptive model through which the pharmaceutical product supply chain can enhance its resilience capabilities. Materials and Methods: The conceptual model is developed for the supply chain of pharmaceutical companies based on the literature survey, and then the conceptual model is explored through factor analysis. Researchers have developed a validated model after a statistical analysis using Cronbach’s alpha. Subjective analysis has concluded that the pharmaceutical supply chain's resilience is driven by factors such as ""trade cost,"" which comprises transport cost, business practices, and raw material sourcing cost; ""shock propagation,"" which comprises country-specific shocks, production shocks, and policy changes; and ""technological infrastructure bottleneck,"" which relates to the availability of cold chain storage warehouses and refrigerated transport vehicle facilities. Results: An empirical model pertaining to supply chain resilience may be further studied with different geographies, like Pune, Hyderabad, and Delhi NCR, for the purpose of generalizing the study. Conclusion: The identified major factors were trade cost, shock propagation, and technological infrastructure bottlenecks. The sensitivity of the issue under investigation required a personal touch to the survey, as the COVID-19 pandemic had left these respondents emotionally vulnerable. As COVID-19 is the recent catastrophe that has hit humanity, it has made the pharmaceutical product distribution channel vulnerable during the pandemic. This difficult time of pandemic has really tested the pharmaceutical products’ supply chain capabilities as well. © 2023, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India.

The Kauai District Health Office (KDHO) of the Hawaii Department of Health serves a rural island community of 73,000 residents. As a state agency, KDHO works closely with the county mayor and administration. Kauai has experienced comparatively low COVID-19 case and case-fatality rates while maintaining strong community and leadership cohesion. Kauai's response was highly rated by residents in a recent Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response survey. In this article, we describe examples of local response efforts in the areas of (1) policy and regulations, (2) health-directed isolation and quarantine, (3) case investigation and contact tracing, (4) testing availability, (5) vaccine rollout and availability, and (6) public information, as well as the factors that have contributed to Kauai's successes. KDHO regularly prioritizes agencywide initiatives that cross program silos; staff have experience using the incident command system in real-world situations; the community health worker team is multicultural, multilingual, and well established; and staff are integral members of the community they serve. Preexisting partnerships were strong, including those with county agencies, healthcare partners, and nongovernmental organizations, which facilitated early and effective collaboration. Response successes include implementation of unified command, coordinated public messaging, early protective measures, effective disease control and outbreak response, attention to secondary impacts of the pandemic, free community testing, mass vaccination, and mobile vaccinations and testing. The value of local health departments engaging regularly and authentically with partners and communities cannot be overstated. It has saved lives on Kauai. Local health jurisdictions should focus on all-hazards and all-staff endeavors to enhance their disaster response effectiveness.

High vaccine acceptance is required. The objective was to determine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its associated factors among Pakistani population. Methods: An online survey using google form, was conducted from January 31st to February 9th, 2021 before the start of the mass vaccination in Pakistan. The questionnaire had questions about demographics plus vaccine hesitancy. We received a total of 1156 responses. Data was analyzed using STATA version 14. We employed descriptive statistics and chi square test. Results: A total of 1156 responses were received. 65% were male and 35% female. Only 6% were uneducated. Thirty percent had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier. Forty-six percent of the respondents would take (acceptance) a vaccine if available. Forty-eight percent and 45% were confident in using USA/UK and Chinese vaccine respectively. Gender and marital status was statistically significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. Concerns about the side effects were 55% while for efficacy it was 69%. Twenty-three percent were concerned about the permissibility of the vaccine on religious grounds. Conclusion: Gender and marital status was significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. Forty-six percent respondents were willing to take the vaccine. Among the vaccine hesitant group, respondents were worried about the side effects, safety and religious permissibility of vaccine. Policy makers and all the relevant stakeholders should consider low vaccine acceptance as a major bottleneck and should devise strategies to address this major issue in the fight against COVID-19. © 2023, Professional Medical Publications.

Research on the economic and sociopolitical consequences is scarce as they can only be evaluated with a time lag. To improve our understanding of future, long‐term developments in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic, we gathered findings from the still unexploited empirical literature on the aftermath of earlier pandemics, epidemics, and other infectious disease outbreaks. On top of this, we scrutinized research on past economic crises to interpret the link between changes in the economy and the health of children. Many of the side effects of battling the spread of the current pandemic, such as school closures, the stigma of infection, or conflicts about vaccines, are not novel and have already been documented in connection with previous infectious disease outbreaks. Results highlight that changes in the financial situation of families and socio‐political challenges affect the situation and daily routine of children and youth in the long term. In consequence, the already pronounced socioeconomic inequalities will likely further increase. On top of this, due to reduced revenues, child protective services are likely to face challenges in the availability of human and financial resources. © 2022 by the authors.

These improvements have deeply affected various disciplines of sciences and consequently changed services such as daily business, particularly health sectors. Innovative digital marketing strategies utilize the channels of social media and retrieved user data to analyze and improve relevant services. These multidisciplinary innovations can assist specialists, physicians and researchers in diagnostic, prophylaxis and treatment issues in the health sector. Accordingly, compared to recent decades, health decision makers are more accurate and trustful in defining new strategies. Interestingly, using social media and mobile health apps in current pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 could be an important instance of the key role of these platforms at the local and global level of health policies. These digital technologies provide platforms to connect public health sectors and health politicians for communicating and spreading relevant information. Adding influencers and campaigns to this toolbox strengthens the implementation of public health programs. In 2016, the WHO adopted a global program to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030. Recent constructive measures that have been used in the battle against COVID-19 could be adopted for the elimination of viral hepatitis program. The presented evidence in our narrative review demonstrates that the application of digital marketing tools to create campaigns on social media, armed with professional influencers, can efficiently consolidate this program. The application of different strategies in using these popular tools will raise the public awareness about viral hepatitis. Subsequently, the availability of an effective vaccine for HBV and antiviral medication for HCV can motivate the audience to take steps towards prophylaxis and screening methods against these infectious illnesses. The encouragement of health policy makers to apply digital communication technologies and comprehensive roadmaps to implement this global program will certainly decrease the burden of viral hepatitis worldwide. © 2022 by the authors.

The study is the first to judge the now completed ""first wave"" of the vaccination efforts. The analysis is very relevant for the understanding why and where the vaccination process observed got stuck by the end of 2021. Methods: Using data from 118 countries globally and weighted least squared and survival analysis, we identify a variety of factors playing crucial roles, including the availability of vaccines, pandemic pressures, economic strength measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), educational development, and political regimes. Results: Examining the speed of vaccinations across countries until the Fall of 2021 when the global process got stuck, we find that initially authoritarian countries are slow in the vaccination process, while education is most relevant for scaling up the campaign, and the economic strength of the economies drives them to higher vaccination rates. In comparison to North and Middle America, European and Asian countries vaccinated initially fast for 5% and 10% vaccination rate thresholds, but became rather slow reaching the 30% vaccination level and above. The findings are robust to various applied estimation methods and model specifications. Conclusions: Democratic countries are much faster than authoritarian countries in their vaccination campaigns when controlling for other factors. This finding suggests that the quality of government and the political environment play a key role in popular support for government policies and programs. However, despite the early success of their vaccination campaigns, the democratic country group has been confronted with strong concerns of vaccine reluctance among their vast populations, indicating the two most potent variables explaining the speed of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign are education and economic conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Economic strength; Educational development; Political regimes; Vaccination",""

Though the Pakistani government has successfully implemented robust policies to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic; however, studies assessing public intention to get COVID-19 vaccination (IGCV) are limited. The aim of this study is to deal with this literature gap and has also expanded the conceptual framework of planned behaviour theory. We have introduced three new considerations (risk perceptions of the pandemic, perceived benefits of the vaccine, and unavailability of vaccine) to have a better understanding of the influencing factors that encourage or discourage public IGCV. Methods: Results are based on a sample collected from 754 households using an inclusive questionnaire survey. Hypotheses are tested by utilizing the structural equation modelling approach. Results: The results disclose that the intention factors, that is, attitude, risk perceptions of the pandemic, and perceived benefits of the vaccine, impart positive effects on public IGCV. In contrast, the cost of the vaccine and the unavailability of the vaccine have negative effects. Notably, environmental concern has an insignificant effect. Conclusions: Research findings emphasize the importance of publicizing the devastating impacts of COVID-19 on society and the environment, ensuring vaccination availability at an accessible price while simultaneously improving public healthcare practices. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Developing Countries; Humans; Intention; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; attitude to health; clinical assessment; clinical practice; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; developing country; drug cost; female; health care access; human; male; pandemic; risk perception; Theory of Planned Behavior; vaccination; behavior; vaccination"

With one of the highest excess death rates globally, Ecuador had a comparatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which may have been influenced by limited availability of data for decision-making due to low laboratory capacity. Methods: We examine de-identified data on 55,063 individuals with suspected COVID-19 between February 27 and April 30, 2020 included in the RT-PCR testing database collected by the Ministry of Health. Processing times and rates per province, and the number of pending tests, were tallied cumulatively. We assessed the relationship between sample shipping, laboratory capacity and case completion using a negative binomial generalized linear model. Results: The national average time for case completion was 3 days; 12.1% of samples took ≥10 days to complete; the national average daily backlog was 29.1 tests per 100,000 people. Only 8 out of 24 provinces had authorized COVID-19 processing laboratories but not all processed samples. There was an association between samples coming from outside the processing laboratory province, the number of other samples present at the laboratory during processing, and the amount of time needed to process a sample. Samples from another province took 1.29 times as long to process, on average. The percentage of pending results on April 30 was 67.1%. Conclusion: A centralized RT-PCR testing system contributes to critical delays in processing, which may mask a case burden higher than reported, impeding timely awareness, and adequate clinical care and vaccination strategies and subsequent monitoring. Although Ecuador adapted or authorized existing facilities to address limitations in laboratory capacity for COVID-19, this study highlights the need to estimate and augment laboratory capabilities for improved decision making and policies on diagnostic guidelines and availability. Support is needed to procure the necessary human and physical resources at all phases of diagnostic testing, including transportation of samples and supplies, and information management.

While the ability to distribute a vaccine in the short-term remains uncertain, the availability of a vaccine alone will not be sufficient to stop disease spread. Instead, policy makers will need to overcome the additional hurdle of rapid widespread adoption. In a large-scale nationally representative survey (N = 34,200), the current work identifies monetary risk preferences as a correlate of take-up of an anticipated COVID-19 vaccine. A complementary experiment (N = 1,003) leverages this insight to create effective messaging encouraging vaccine take-up. Individual differences in risk preferences moderate responses to messaging that provides benchmarks for vaccine efficacy (by comparing it to the flu vaccine), while messaging that describes pro-social benefits of vaccination (specifically herd immunity) speeds vaccine take-up irrespective of risk preferences.

The study drew on information from the national sanitary registration database, made available by ANVISA; a document analysis of official/normative publi-cations; and data from published literature. The data shows the incorporation of vaccines into the PNI, evidencing that Brazil is a country with industrial potential for vaccine production but that is still focused on the transfer of technologies and in need of public attention and investments for developing new technologies as a way to ensure the sector’s independence. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

The adopted policies and formulated guidelines showed that different countries prioritized values differently. Amongst the most challenging ethical debates during the COVID-19 pandemic were attempts to formulate clinical ethical guidelines on how limited medical resources and services ought to be allocated should the need exceed availability.

An immediate medical breakthrough is needed. However, parallel to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the proliferation of information regarding the pandemic, which, if uncontrolled, cannot only mislead the public but also hinder the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders in mitigating the effect of this pandemic. It is known that media communications can affect public perception and attitude toward medical treatment, vaccination, or subject matter, particularly when the population has limited knowledge on the subject. Objective: This study attempts to systematically scrutinize media communications (Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts) to understand the prevailing sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. Methods: A total of 637 Twitter posts and 569 Google News headlines or descriptions, retrieved between February 2 and May 5, 2020, were analyzed using three standard computational linguistics models (ie, TextBlob, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, and Word2Vec combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network). Results: Our findings revealed that, contrary to general perceptions, Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts within the stated period were generally passive or positive toward COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. It was possible to understand these patterns in light of increasingly sustained efforts by various media and health actors in ensuring the availability of factual information about the pandemic. Conclusions: This type of analysis could contribute to understanding predominant polarities and associated potential attitudinal inclinations. Such knowledge could be critical in informing relevant public health and media engagement policies. © Sefater Gbashi, Oluwafemi Ayodeji Adebo, Wesley Doorsamy, Patrick Berka Njobeh.","Communication; Computation; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Infodemic; Infodemiology; Infoveillance; Linguistic; Media; Model; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Vaccine",""

Therefore, immunization is recognized to play a central role in reaching the SDGs, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite continuous interventions to strengthen immunization systems and to adequately respond to emergency immunization during epidemics, the immunization-related indicators for SDG3 lag behind in sub-Saharan Africa. Especially taking into account the current Covid19 pandemic, the current performance on the connected SDGs is both a cause and a result of this. Methods: We conduct a literature review through a keyword search strategy complemented with handpicking and snowballing from earlier reviews. After title and abstract screening, we conducted a qualitative analysis of key insights and categorized them according to showing the impact of immunization on SDGs, sustainability challenges, and model-based solutions to these challenges. Results: We reveal the leveraging mechanisms triggered by immunization and position them vis-à-vis the SDGs, within the framework of Public Health and Planetary Health. Several challenges for sustainable control of vaccine-preventable diseases are identified: access to immunization services, global vaccine availability to LMICs, context-dependent vaccine effectiveness, safe and affordable vaccines, local/regional vaccine production, public-private partnerships, and immunization capacity/capability building. Model-based approaches that support SDG-promoting interventions concerning immunization systems are analyzed in light of the strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030. Conclusions: In general terms, it can be concluded that relevant future research requires (i) design for system resilience, (ii) transdisciplinary modeling, (iii) connecting interventions in immunization with SDG outcomes, (iv) designing interventions and their implementation simultaneously, (v) offering tailored solutions, and (vi) model coordination and integration of services and partnerships. The research and health community is called upon to join forces to activate existing knowledge, generate new insights and develop decision-supporting tools for Low-and Middle-Income Countries’ health authorities and communities to leverage immunization in its transformational role toward successfully meeting the SDGs in 2030. © 2021, The Author(s).","Health systems modeling; Immunization; Low- and middle-income countries; Sustainable development goals; Systems thinking","COVID-19; Global Health; Goals; Humans; Immunization; SARS-CoV-2; Sustainable Development; Vaccine Efficacy; Sub-Saharan Africa; vaccine; COVID-19; health policy; immunization; literature review; low income population; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; antibiotic resistance; artificial intelligence; behavior change; climate change; coronavirus disease 2019; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; diplomacy; disease surveillance; disease transmission; drug surveillance program; education; electronic health record; environmental health; genomic instability; health care; health care cost; health care delivery; health care facility; health care policy; health care system; health insurance; human; hunger; immune response; immunization; middle income country; morbidity; motivation; pandemic; population growth; poverty; public-private partnership; qualitative analysis; Review; risk factor; root cause analysis; sustainable development; thermostability; total quality management; vaccination; vaccine preventable disease; vaccine production; Wart virus; global health; immunization; sustainable development"

These have included interruptions to programs that aimed to prevent, control, and eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released interim guidelines recommending the temporary cessation of mass drug administration (MDA), community-based surveys, and case detection, while encouraging continuation of morbidity management and vector control where possible. Over the course of the following months, national programs and implementing partners contributed to COVID-19 response efforts, while also beginning to plan for resumption of NTD control activities. To understand the challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for maximizing continuity of disease control during public health emergencies, we sought perspectives from Nigeria and Guinea on the process of restarting NTD control efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through semistructured interviews with individuals involved with NTD control at the local and national levels, we identified key themes and common perspectives between the 2 countries, as well as observations that were specific to each. Overall, interviewees stressed the challenges posed by COVID-19 interruptions, particularly with respect to delays to activities and related knock-on impacts, such as drug expiry and prolonged elimination timelines, as well as concerns related to funding. However, respondents in both countries also highlighted the benefits of a formal risk assessment approach, particularly in terms of encouraging information sharing and increasing coordination and advocacy. Recommendations included ensuring greater availability of historical data to allow better monitoring of how future emergencies affect NTD control progress; continuing to use risk assessment approaches in the future; and identifying mechanisms for sharing lessons learned and innovations between countries as a means of advancing postpandemic health systems and disease control capacity strengthening. © 2021 McKay et al.","","Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Government Programs; Guinea; Humans; Mass Drug Administration; Neglected Diseases; Nigeria; SARS-CoV-2; Tropical Medicine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; disease control; disease surveillance; drug industry; environmental sanitation; geographic distribution; health care delivery; health care policy; human; immunization; Nigeria; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; public health service; questionnaire; risk assessment; semi structured interview; social determinants of health; tropical disease; vaccination; World Health Organization; communicable disease control; economics; government; Guinea; mass drug administration; neglected disease; Nigeria; organization and management; procedures; tropical medicine"

The availability of COVID-19 vaccines has had a profound effect on the trajectory of the pandemic, with wide-ranging benefits. We aimed to estimate the total societal economic value generated in the US from COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We developed a population-based economic model informed by existing data and literature to estimate the total societal value generated from COVID-19 vaccines by avoiding COVID-19 infections as well as resuming social and economic activity more quickly. To do this, we separately estimated the value generated from life years saved, healthcare costs avoided, quality of life gained, and US gross domestic product (GDP) gained under a range of plausible assumptions. Results: Findings from our base case analysis suggest that from their launch in December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines were projected to generate $5.0 trillion in societal economic value for the US from avoided COVID-19 infections and resuming unrestricted social and economic activity more quickly. Our scenario analyses suggest that the value could range between $1.8 and $9.9 trillion. Our model indicates that the most substantial sources of value are derived from reduction in prevalence of depression ($1.9 trillion), gains to US GDP ($1.4 trillion), and lives saved from fewer COVID-19 infections ($1.0 trillion). Limitations: Constructed as a projection from December 2020, our model does not account for the Delta or future variants, nor does it account for improvements in COVID-19 treatment. Conclusions: The magnitude of economic benefit from vaccination highlights the need for coordinated policy decisions to support continued widespread vaccine uptake in the US. © 2022 The Author(s).

Fontan surgery (FS) is the procedure of choice, as it bypasses the flow from the caval veins to the pulmonary circulation but requires close monitoring for late complications. The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic caused nations to prioritize the availability of human and material health resources to benefit those infected. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical consequences of hospital reconversion due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a univentricular heart clinic for patients with FS from the bioethical perspective. Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in a captive cohort of patients with FS treated in a tertiary hospital with conversion to COVID-19 patient care. The consequences of discontinuation of follow-up were recorded. Qualitative variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages, and quantitative variables as medians and interquartile ranges (p25-p75). Comparison between the two groups was performed with the χ2 test. Results: We included 51 patients with a median age of 13 years and a follow-up of 5 years. The male: female ratio was 0.88:1.12, and 41% (21) presented failures. More than 90% of the patients presented needs for medications and imaging studies.The two patients cared for in palliative care discontinued their care.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from February 16 to March 16, 2021, by administering an online questionnaire to the Chinese residents. RESULTS: Of 5240 residents who completed the survey, 464 (8.9%) participants reported to have had one shot, and 348 (6.6%) reported to have had 2 shots. At the time the questionnaire was administered, 2298 (43.9%) participants reported they wanted to get vaccinated, while 2255 (43.0%) declared that they still did not know, and 687 (13.1%) respondents declared vaccine refusal. Overall, 2255 (43%) participants were categorized as vaccine hesitancy. Female participants (p=0.000), <20 years old (p=0.000), have low risk of COVID-19 (p=0.000) infection and strong associations of vaccine hesitancy. eHealth literacy was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show high rates of vaccine hesitancy in China. This could pose a serious threat to the preventive measures that aimed at controlling COVID-19 spread in the country. The government and different media platforms should encourage the dissemination of correct information about vaccines, the communities and medical staff to improve residents' knowledge about vaccines, and strive to improve residents' electronic health literacy. © 2021 Associacao Medica Brasileira.

To establish reciprocal trust and respect, the communication between care providers and patients must be skilled and appropriate, and the time devoted to communication must be considered time of care. But in Italy, in the last decades costs containment policy in the organizations of the National Health Service critically shortened the time available for care. Today, doctors and other healthcare professionals literally do not have the time to establish appropriate care relationships, and this causes a widespread and increasing distrust of patients and their families in the care system. During COVID-19 pandemic also vaccine hesitancy, defined by experts as a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services, was mainly due to a lack of confidence in care system and in scientific research. Slow Medicine ETS, an Italian proactive movement of healthcare professionals and citizens, following the example of the initiative ‘Building Trust’ recently activated by the ABIM Foundation in the USA, launched a national initiative aimed to promote and plan concrete actions to restore and consolidate people’s trust in healthcare professionals and organizations, in researchers, in scientific and rational approach to knowledge and in its use for the improvement of health and quality of life.

Objective: the article aims to illustrate the difference between the utilitarian-collectivist approach and the deontologic approach, which inspired the guidelines drawn up in Italy in 2021 by SIAARTI in collaboration with SIMLA. Materials and methods: the article draws upon international scientific sources and documents from ethics committees and scientific societies on triage for Covid-19 patients in intensive care. Results: only medical parameters should be evaluated to establish the prognosis through which to identify the patients to be treated as a priority. If non-medical standards are taken into account, such as patient age, discrimination is likely to arise, and the patient’s interest is somehow subordinated to that of the community. Discussion: it is not part of the doctor’s duty to exclude patients from intensive care in order to grant access to treatment to those most likely to survive. Guaranteeing treatment availability for as many patients as possible is the duty of national and local health policy managers, and cannot be deemed to be the doctors’ responsibility. Conclusion: moral judgment cannot concern only the choices of doctors. According to the principle of beneficence, hospital directors and national and local health policy managers must also take action, in particular to eliminate waste of economic resources so as to allocate more of them to health protection, especially in consideration of the predictability with which infection rates increase, and in light of the fact that immunization through vaccination is only temporary.

METHODS: We adapted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative Method, which allows for crowdsourcing ideas from diverse stakeholders and engages technical experts in prioritizing these ideas using predefined scoring criteria. Crowdsourcing surveys solicited ideas from CMC families, school staff, clinicians and administrators through statewide distribution groups/listservs using the prompt: “It is safe for children with complex health issues and those around them (families, teachers, classmates, etc.) to go to school in-person during the COVID-19 pandemic if/when …” Ideas were aggregated and synthesized into a unique list of candidate priorities. Thirty-four experts then scored each candidate priority against 5 criteria (equity, impact on COVID-19, practicality, sustainability, and cost) using a 5-point Likert scale. Scores were weighted and predefined thresholds applied to identify consensus priorities. RESULTS: From May to June 2021, 460 stakeholders contributed 1166 ideas resulting in 87 candidate priorities. After applying weighted expert scores, 10 consensus CMC-specific priorities exceeded predetermined thresholds. These priorities centered on integrating COVID-19 safety and respiratory action planning into individualized education plans, educating school communities about CMC’s unique COVID-19 risks, using medical equipment safely, maintaining curricular flexibility, ensuring masking and vaccination, assigning seats during transportation, and availability of testing and medical staff at school. CONCLUSIONS: Priorities for CMC, identified by statewide stakeholders, complement and extend existing recommendations. These priorities can guide implementation efforts to support safer in-person education for CMC.

The urgency for COVID-19 vaccines determined a dilution of the general expectations of safety and efficacy of vaccination (from safe and effective to safe and effective enough). In many countries, a no-fault program was established to compensate individuals who experienced serious vaccine-related injuries. The impressive number of administrations worldwide and the legal indemnity afforded to manufacturers of approved vaccines that cannot be pursued for compensation fed the debate about the availability of a compensation model for COVID-19 vaccine-related injuries. Several European countries have long introduced a system, Vaccine Injury Compensation Programs, to compensate people who suffer physical harm because of vaccination. In Europe, COVID-19 vaccination is strongly recommended for the general population and in many states is declared mandatory for healthcare workers. In 1992, Italy edited Law no. 210 providing legal protection for individuals who reported injuries after mandatory and recommended vaccinations as a no-fault alternative to the traditional tort system. Despite its recommended nature, COVID-19 vaccination is excluded from the no-fault model in several European states, and the Italian government is called to provide clear and firm instructions for the management of the many requests for compensation. The authors provide an overview of the existing compensation models in Europe and analyse available legislative proposals. © 2021 by the authors.

We examined current knowledge of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR). We have systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar with the following MeSH terms: 'SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,' or 'COVID-19 vaccine,' and 'organ transplantation' and 'booster' or 'third dose.' This review article examines a number of studies including guidelines from professional societies examining the safety as well as increased immunogenicity of a booster dose among SOTR. Equitable distribution of vaccines across the globe is the need of the hour. While some countries are well into the booster dose phase, the lower-income countries are languishing behind with primary doses for their health workers. Available reports suggest less efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in SOTR suggesting booster dose for them. Several studies highlighted the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines booster dose among SOTR. SOTR should also continue to adhere to all safety and COVID-19 appropriate behaviors. There is a growing need for alternative strategies to improve protection. As Omicron cases rise around the world, India announced that COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 15-18 years and 'precautionary (booster) doses' would be administered to healthcare and frontline workers and people above 60 years of age with comorbidities from January 2022. In near future, with increased availability of vaccinations, all SOTR will have access to booster dose in a phased manner. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The availability of accurate information during the pandemic, its reported sources and their confidentiality play a key role on the public reported opinions toward the vaccination topic. The society used the social media extensively during the pandemic and quarantine periods to track the COVID-19 news and follow the updates of the vaccines' development process. In this study, we focused on revealing the public attitudes of the COVID-19 vaccination process on twitter as a social media platform using machine learning. The tweets are collected and preprocessed for features extraction and reduction step and the K-means clustering algorithm is used to group the vaccines related tweets in order to use the Amazon Comprehend module for sentiment analysis. Most of the reported opinions that discussed the vaccines efficiency, safety, and the governments distribution plans and the policies to secure the doses for their residents were neutral. The second largest group has negative opinions according to the inaccurate information about vaccines development process, their side effects, and unsuccessful reported trials of vaccines production during different pandemic periods. Our study highlighted the urgent need for interactive communications with the society from different cultural and educational backgrounds in order to increase the vaccination awareness and validate its related news. The deliverable speech of the health care decision makers should simplify the vaccines related scientific terms, address the community concerns, and make the vaccination distribution plans publicly available for their underlying communities. © 2021 IEEE.","COVID-19; machine learning; perceptions; social media; vaccines","Decision making; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Vaccines; COVID-19; Development process; Feature extraction and reductions; K-means clustering algorithms; Public attitudes; Public perception; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social media platforms; Vaccine development; Social networking (online)"

Perspectives were garnered from researchers, clinicians, and policy experts in eight countries and the data provides a first approximation of staffing before and during the pandemic. Five broad categories of staff working in LTC homes were as follows: (1) those responsible for personal and support care, (2) nursing care, (3) medical care, (4) rehabilitation and recreational care, and (5) others. There is limited availability of data related to measuring staff complement in the home and those with similar roles had different titles making it difficult to compare between countries.

Lessons learnt could inform the roll-out of similar programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. To describe the trends of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines in the first three months (February-May 2021) of the Zimbabwe vaccination programme and the lessons learnt. Methods: a secondary descriptive analysis of routinely available COVID-19 vaccination data extracted from the daily situation reports published by the Ministry of Health and Child Care. Results: in the first three months of the programme, 1 020 078 doses were administered, with 675 678 being first doses and 344 400 were second doses. Using population estimates, at three months, 5.2% of the population had received at least one dose and 2.6% had received the full two doses. Uptake was initially slow, followed by a gradual, and subsequently an exponential increase. Conclusion: by the end of May 2021, Zimbabwe had rolled out one of the largest COVID-19 vaccination programme in sub-Saharan Africa. The uptake followed a pattern and trend that is consistent with vaccine hesitancy reported in the literature, driven by a combination of confidence, complacency and convenience factors. The gradual increase in uptake followed a series of national and local community engagement programmes. The roll-out of similar programmes must recognise likely patterns of uptake across the population and ensure plans are in place to address vaccine hesitancy. The available data did not allow granular analysis to understand the demographics of people who participated in the programme, which is important for surveillance, targeted action, preventing inequalities and ensuring adequate and proportionate protection of residents prioritising the most vulnerable. Further analysis of the process, outcomes and impact of the programme will be helpful in informing the roll-out of similar programmes across Africa. © 2021, African Field Epidemiology Network.

The prompt availability of effective and affordable vaccines offers the most promising path out of the pandemic. Global solidarity was reflected in the early publication of the genome sequence and the sharing of protocols for the PCR test. However, WHO’s proposed “solidarity vaccine trial” which would yield comparative data about vaccines and the proposal that vaccine technologies be shared to accelerate vaccine development and production were rejected by pharma. In March global cooperation around diagnostics, medicines and vaccines moved from WHO to the ‘Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator’, a new ‘multi-stakeholder public private partnership. The “vaccine arm” of the Accelerator was the Covax Facility which would mobilise donor funds to pay for vaccines for the 20% priority populations in low and lower middle income countries. By July however, it was clear that massive bilateral advanced purchase agreements by the high income countries would reserve most of the early supply of effective vaccines and jeopardise the fund-raising for Covax. The rise of ‘vaccine nationalism’ looks set to cause long delays in access to vaccination in many L&MICs, and significant morbidity and mortality as a consequence.

The disease is caused by the corona virus, transmitted from human to human through droplet infection. The virus was first identified in China in December 2019, and spread worldwide. Despite the virus being highly infectious, there is no cure for coronavirus disease COVID-19. The current global approach in the fight against COVID-19 focuses on travel bans including border closures, restrictions on mass gatherings, and mass vaccination of all adults. However, the travel bans and border closures have shown to negatively affect availability, accessibility, and affordability of basic needs such as food, especially for populations in the low- to middle-income countries. This is so since a good percentage of population in low- to middle-income countries live on hand to mouth, and cannot afford adequate food stock to sustain them for a long period of time. In addition, there is a challenge to afford purchasing storage facilities such as refrigerators for storage of fresh foods. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative literature review is to unveil the impact of government policies on individual choices of food and potential impact on outcomes and nutrition in children, elderly and chronically ill individuals in the COVID-19 pandemic era in low- and middle-income countries from 2020 to 2021. © The Author(s) 2022.","Corona virus; COVID-19; developing countries; food; nutrition","case fatality rate; child nutrition; coronavirus disease 2019; food shortage; geriatric nutrition; human; lipid diet; low income country; middle income country; nutrition; nutritional status; pandemic; Review; underweight; virus transmission; vulnerable population"

Vaccine hesitancy is a major barrier towards high vaccination rates. We evaluated the relationship between COVID-19 vaccine uptake and vaccine hesitancy, and then examined whether community factors were associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy. Methods: We constructed and evaluated a cross-sectional, county-level dataset that included the levels of vaccination uptake and vaccine hesitancy, and population characteristics based on those included in the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index. Results: Across 3142 US counties, vaccine hesitancy was significantly and negatively correlated with vaccine uptake rates (r = -0.06, P value <.01). The 2 predictors associated with a low vaccination level within highly hesitant communities were: no high school education (OR:0.70, P value <.001), and concern on vaccine availability and distribution (CVAC) (OR:0.00, P value <.001). The most common reason driving vaccine hesitancy was lack of trust in COVID-19 vaccines (55%), followed by concerns around side effects of the vaccine (48%), and lack of trust in government (46%). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a public health threat. Our findings suggest that low education levels are a major contributor to vaccine hesitancy and ultimately vaccination levels. Since education levels are not easily modifiable, our results suggest that policymakers would be best served by closing knowledge gaps to overcome negative perceptions of the vaccine through tailored interventions. © 2022 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.","Education; Health Services Research; Public Health; Vaccination","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; adult; age; aged; Article; Asian; attitude to health; Black person; Caucasian; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; disabled person; educational status; employment status; family size; female; government; health care access; health care delivery; health care policy; health education; high school; Hispanic; human; language ability; major clinical study; male; middle aged; minority group; multiracial person; poverty; prediction; single parent; social status; Social Vulnerability Index; trust; unemployment; United States; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy; young adult; prevention and control; vaccination"

Its richness in text-based data in the form of posts and comments allows researchers to identify popular topics and assess public sentiment. Nonetheless, the vast majority of topic extraction and sentiment analysis based on social media is performed on the platform or country level and does not account for local culture and policies. Objective: The aim of this study is to use location-based subreddits on Reddit to study city-level variations in sentiments toward vaccine-related topics. Methods: Comments on posts providing regular updates on COVID-19 statistics in the Vancouver (r/vancouver, n=49,291), Toronto (r/toronto, n=20,764), and Calgary (r/calgary, n=21,277) subreddits between July 13, 2020, and June 14, 2021, were extracted. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to identify frequently discussed topics. Sentiment (joy, sadness, fear, and anger) scores were assigned to comments through random forest regression. Results: The number of comments on the 250 posts from the Vancouver subreddit positively correlated with the number of new daily COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (R=0.51, 95% CI for slope 0.18-0.29; P<.001). From the comments, 13 topics were identified. Two were related to vaccines, 1 regarding vaccine uptake and the other about vaccine supply. The levels of discussion for both topics were linked to the total number of vaccines administered (Granger test for causality, P<.001). Comments pertaining to either topic displayed higher scores for joy than for other topics (P<.001). Calgary and Toronto also discussed vaccine uptake. Sentiment scores for this topic differed across the 3 cities (P<.001). Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that data from city-specific subreddits can be used to better understand concerns and sentiments around COVID-19 vaccines at the local level. This can potentially lead to more targeted and publicly acceptable policies based on content on social media. © 2021 Cathy Yan, Melanie Law, Stephanie Nguyen, Janelle Cheung, Jude Kong.","Canada; Communication; Concern; COVID-19; Emotion; Hesitancy; Opinion; Pandemic; Public sentiment; Reddit; Sentiment; Social media; Vaccine","British Columbia; Cities; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; anger; Article; British Columbia; Canadian; causality; city; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; emotion; fatality; fear; happiness; health care availability; home care; human; major clinical study; public health; public opinion; random forest; sadness; social media; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy"

Recent Findings: To mitigate the potential impact of COVID-19 on the HIV response and protect the gains, continuity of treatment was the guiding principle regarding the provision of services in PEPFAR-supported countries. As the COVID-19 pandemic matured, PEPFAR’s approach evolved from a strictly “protect and salvage” approach to a “restore and accelerate” approach that embraced innovative adaptations in service and “person-centered” care. Summary: The impact of service delivery interruptions caused by COVID-19 on progress towards HIV epidemic control in PEPFAR-supported African countries remains undetermined. With COVID vaccine coverage many months away and more transmissible variants being reported, Africa may experience more pandemic surges. HIV programs will depend on nimble and innovative adaptations in prevention and treatment services in order to advance epidemic control objectives. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Africa; Continuity of services; COVID-19; HIV; PEPFAR; Program adaptation","Africa; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; HIV Infections; Humans; International Cooperation; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Africa; breast feeding; coronavirus disease 2019; health care access; health care availability; health care delivery; health care financing; health care personnel management; health care policy; health care quality; health service; high risk population; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infant care; infection control; laboratory test; medical information system; national lockdown; pandemic; patient care; pregnant woman; Review; tuberculosis; vaccination coverage; virus transmission; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; international cooperation; pandemic; prevention and control"

Although these policies were intended to protect residents, they may have had unintended negative effects. Objective: To assess health outcomes among SNFs with and without known COVID-19 cases. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective observational study used US Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set 3.0 for January through November in each year beginning in 2018 and ending in 2020 including 15477 US SNFs with 2985864 resident-years. Exposures: January through November of calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020. COVID-19 diagnoses were used to assign SNFs into 2 mutually exclusive groups with varying membership by month in 2020: active COVID-19 (≥1 COVID-19 diagnosis in the current or past month) or no-known COVID-19 (no observed diagnosis by that month). Main Outcomes and Measures: Monthly rates of mortality, hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and monthly changes in activities of daily living (ADLs), body weight, and depressive symptoms. Each SNF in 2018 and 2019 served as its own control for 2020. Results: In 2018-2019, mean monthly mortality was 2.2%, hospitalization 3.0%, and ED visit rate 2.9% overall. In 2020, among active COVID-19 SNFs compared with their own 2018-2019 baseline, mortality increased by 1.60% (95% CI, 1.58% to 1.62%), hospitalizations decreased by 0.10% (95% CI, -0.12% to -0.09%), and ED visit rates decreased by 0.57% (95% CI, -0.59% to -0.55%). Among no-known COVID-19 SNFs, mortality decreased by 0.15% (95% CI, -0.16% to -0.13%), hospitalizations by 0.83% (95% CI, -0.85% to -0.81%), and ED visits by 0.79% (95% CI, -0.81% to -0.77%). All changes were statistically significant. In 2018-2019, across all SNFs, residents required assistance with an additional 0.89 ADLs between January and November, and lost 1.9 lb; 27.1% had worsened depressive symptoms. In 2020, residents in active COVID-19 SNFs required assistance with an additional 0.36 ADLs (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.38), lost 3.1 lb (95% CI, -3.2 to -3.0 lb) more weight, and were 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1% to 4.7%) more likely to have worsened depressive symptoms, all statistically significant changes. In 2020, residents in no-known COVID-19 SNFs had no significant change in ADLs (-0.06 [95% CI, -0.12 to 0.01]), but lost 1.8 lb (95% CI, -2.1 to -1.5 lb) more weight and were 3.2% more likely (95% CI, 2.3% to 4.1%) to have worsened depressive symptoms, both statistically significant changes. Conclusions and Relevance: Among skilled nursing facilities in the US during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and prior to the availability of COVID-19 vaccination, mortality and functional decline significantly increased at facilities with active COVID-19 cases compared with the prepandemic period, while a modest statistically significant decrease in mortality was observed at facilities that had never had a known COVID-19 case. Weight loss and depressive symptoms significantly increased in skilled nursing facilities in the first year of the pandemic, regardless of COVID-19 status.  © 2022 American Medical Association.

Specific topics include preventing the spread of respiratory viruses, promoting immunization, and the diagnosis and treatment of suspected respiratory infection. Policy-relevant issues are discussed, including whether to mandate influenza immunization for staff, the availability and use of personal protective equipment, supporting staff if they become ill, and the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Research is applicable in all of these areas, including regarding the use of emerging electronic decision support tools.

The pandemic has exacerbated inequalities of access to care in vulnerable populations within the Canadian mental healthcare system. Primary care services are first-line health services in Canada, and are necessary to access specialized services. However, as a result of the limited availability of primary health services, and subsequently, specialized providers (eg, psychiatrists), the demand for these services outweigh the supply. Hitherto, timely access to appropriate services has been cited as a common challenge in Canada as a result of limitations as it relates to resources and in-person activities and support services. While there has been an increase in virtual care opportunities, concerns have been raised with respect to the digital divide. Moreover, while individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) and psychosis are at an increased risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19, testing and vaccination services have not been prioritized for this population. Taken together, increased funding for mental health service delivery should be emphasized especially for individuals with SMI. There should also be a focus on increased collaboration among individuals with lived experience and health care providers to ensure future policies are developed specifically for this population. Addressing the social determinants of health and prioritizing a continuum of care across various stakeholders may lead to strong integration of care both during and after the pandemic.  © 2022 The Author(s).

At least three COVID-19 vaccines have been approved or are about to be approved for distribution in many countries. However, with very limited initial availability, only a minority of the population will be able to receive vaccines this winter. Urgent decisions will have to be made about who should receive priority for access. Current policy in the UK appears to take the view that those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 should get the vaccine first. While this is intuitively attractive, we argue that there are other possible values and criteria that need to be considered. These include both intrinsic and instrumental values. The former are numbers of lives saved, years of life saved, quality of the lives saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and possibly others including age. Instrumental values include protecting healthcare systems and other broader societal interests, which might require prioritizing key worker status and having dependants. The challenge from an ethical point of view is to strike the right balance among these values. It also depends on effectiveness of different vaccines on different population groups and on modelling around cost-effectiveness of different strategies. It is a mistake to simply assume that prioritizing the most vulnerable is the best strategy. Although that could end up being the best approach, whether it is or not requires careful ethical and empirical analysis. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite developing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, LGBTQ+ communities still faces challenges due to inequitable access and vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is a delay in the acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services. Various studies have explored and tried to address factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. However, the LGBTQ+ population remains under- and misrepresented in many of these studies. According to the few studies that have focused on the LGBTQ+ population, several factors influencing vaccine hesitancy have been identified, with the most common factors in studies being concern about vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy, and history of bad experiences with healthcare providers. In order to rebuild the confidence of LGBTQ+ people in vaccines, governments, healthcare policymakers, and healthcare providers need to start by acknowledging, and then resolving, these disparities; building trust; dismantling systemic suppression and discrimination; and prioritizing the inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in research studies and public health policies. © 2021 by the authors.

A benefit:harm balance analysis suggests that while vaccination has a highly favourable benefit:harm balance, the balance in instituting a “no jab, no job” policy is highly uncertain and may be unfavourable. Furthermore, there are practical difficulties and legal uncertainties. The much misunderstood precautionary principle dictates that if the benefit:harm balance of an intervention is unclear and may be unfavourable, the intervention should not be undertaken. Furthermore, the onus is on those who believe that the benefit:harm balance will be favourable to prove that it is so; it is not for the sceptics to prove that it isn’t. In the absence of good evidence in favour, this is an intervention that would be best avoided. Since the SARS-CoV2 vaccines were developed, the question of whether a policy of encouraging healthcare workers to undergo vaccination, in the absence of medical contraindications, by otherwise declining to employ them in frontline healthcare, has been the subject of a great deal of discussion, including personal opinion, sometimes tinged with emotion, and argument by analogy. Many countries have now made this mandatory for healthcare staff, including NHS staff in England, who will have to be vaccinated by 1 April 2022.1 Such discussions are by no means new, and healthcare workers are already required or encouraged to undergo some forms of vaccination against diseases such as hepatitis B as part of their employment, mandatory in some countries and recommended in others,2 3 including the UK.4 5 Every intervention we undertake in healthcare is undertaken in the expectation that it will bring benefit. Furthermore, the chance of benefit from the intervention should outweigh the possibility of harm, which can never be ruled out.6 However, failing to introduce an intervention can also lead to harm. In order to assess whether to introduce an intervention, an analysis of the benefit to harm balance is necessary. Three questions inform the assessment: 1. What is the chance of benefit from the intervention? 2. What is the chance of harm from the intervention? 3. What is the chance of harm from not intervening? When assessing these chances, the nature of the benefits and harms should be taken into account as well as the raw probabilities. So too should the availability of other interventions, which might be equally or more beneficial and less harmful. When considering any intervention in clinical practice in general, the answers to these questions should ideally come from large randomised population studies. Assessing the benefit:harm balance in an individual is more difficult because one rarely knows in advance what the likely individual response will be. Each occasion of intervention is, in effect, an experiment. That is why it is generally a good pharmacological principle, when embarking on a course of treatment, to start with a low dose of a medicine, carefully increasing the dose while monitoring for beneficial and adverse effects. But for one-off treatments, like vaccination, one has to rely on expectations from population studies. What do we find when we subject the intervention of vaccination against SARS-CoV2 and the policy of “no jab, no job” to benefit:harm balance analyses? © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Methods: an online qualitative survey was conducted, consisting of 30 semi-structured questions. Results: four hundred and ninety-five (495) respondents participated, ranging in age from 18 to 59 years. Over 40% of all respondents were critical of public health information. Participants saw provision of social support measures (n = 83), lack of economic, financial and social support (n = 65), enforcement of restrictions on movement outside the home, availability of face-masks and social distancing (n = 53) and provision of COVID-19 testing (n = 48) as the major things that were handled poorly by the government and health authorities. Conclusion: we advocate coordinated forward planning for public safety until vaccines are widely available; while social distancing should continue. Policymakers need to be adaptable to changing conditions, given fluctuating case numbers and fatality rates. © Obinna Ositadimma Oleribe et al.","COVID-19; Nigeria; Public perceptions","Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Humans; Masks; Middle Aged; Nigeria; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult; adult; age; Article; attitude to health; attitude to illness; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; cross-sectional study; economic recession; female; financial management; governmental organization; health care personnel; health care policy; health service; health survey; human; male; medical information; medical resource shortage; middle aged; mortality rate; Nigerian; online analysis; public health service; qualitative analysis; safety; semi structured interview; social attitude; social distancing; social participation; social support; treatment planning; vaccination; adolescent; mask; Nigeria; young adult"

COVID-19 vaccination was crucial to preventing and eliminating the disease, so vaccine development for COVID-19 was fast-tracked worldwide. Despite the fact that vaccination is commonly recognized as the most effective approach, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is a global health issue. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of nurses in four different regions in Italy between 20 and 28 December 2020 to obtain data on the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination in order to plan specific interventions to increase the rate of vaccine coverage. Results: A total of 531 out of the 5000 nurses invited completed the online questionnaire. Most of the nurses enrolled in the study (73.4%) were female. Among the nurses, 91.5% intended to accept vaccination, whereas 2.3% were opposed and 6.2% were undecided. Female sex and confidence in vaccine efficacy represent the main predictors of vaccine intention among the study population using a logistic regression model, while other factors including vaccine safety concerns (side effects) were non-significant. Conclusions: Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, intention to be vaccinated was suboptimal among nurses in our sample. We also found a significant number of people undecided as to whether to accept the vaccine. Contrary to expectations, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were not found to affect the acceptance rate; nurses’ perception of vaccine efficacy and female sex were the main influencing factors on attitudes toward vaccination in our sample. Since the success of the COVID-19 immunization plan depends on the uptake rate, these findings are of great interest for public health policies. Interventions aimed at increasing employee awareness of vaccination efficacy should be promoted among nurses in order to increase the number of vaccinated people. © 2021 by the authors.

To generate data to optimise selection of booster vaccines, we investigated the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of seven different COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNtech, hearafter referred to as BNT). Methods: COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19. Participants were aged older than 30 years, and were at least 70 days post two doses of ChAd or at least 84 days post two doses of BNT primary COVID-19 immunisation course, with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18 sites were split into three groups (A, B, and C). Within each site group (A, B, or C), participants were randomly assigned to an experimental vaccine or control. Group A received NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax; hereafter referred to as NVX), a half dose of NVX, ChAd, or quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY)control (1:1:1:1). Group B received BNT, VLA2001 (Valneva; hereafter referred to as VLA), a half dose of VLA, Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen; hereafter referred to as Ad26) or MenACWY (1:1:1:1:1). Group C received mRNA1273 (Moderna; hereafter referred to as m1273), CVnCov (CureVac; hereafter referred to as CVn), a half dose of BNT, or MenACWY (1:1:1:1). Participants and all investigatory staff were blinded to treatment allocation. Coprimary outcomes were safety and reactogenicity and immunogenicity of anti-spike IgG measured by ELISA. The primary analysis for immunogenicity was on a modified intention-to-treat basis; safety and reactogenicity were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes included assessment of viral neutralisation and cellular responses. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 73765130. Findings: Between June 1 and June 30, 2021, 3498 people were screened. 2878 participants met eligibility criteria and received COVID-19 vaccine or control. The median ages of ChAd/ChAd-primed participants were 53 years (IQR 44–61) in the younger age group and 76 years (73–78) in the older age group. In the BNT/BNT-primed participants, the median ages were 51 years (41–59) in the younger age group and 78 years (75–82) in the older age group. In the ChAd/ChAD-primed group, 676 (46·7%) participants were female and 1380 (95·4%) were White, and in the BNT/BNT-primed group 770 (53·6%) participants were female and 1321 (91·9%) were White. Three vaccines showed overall increased reactogenicity: m1273 after ChAd/ChAd or BNT/BNT; and ChAd and Ad26 after BNT/BNT. For ChAd/ChAd-primed individuals, spike IgG geometric mean ratios (GMRs) between study vaccines and controls ranged from 1·8 (99% CI 1·5–2·3) in the half VLA group to 32·3 (24·8–42·0) in the m1273 group. GMRs for wild-type cellular responses compared with controls ranged from 1·1 (95% CI 0·7–1·6) for ChAd to 3·6 (2·4–5·5) for m1273. For BNT/BNT-primed individuals, spike IgG GMRs ranged from 1·3 (99% CI 1·0–1·5) in the half VLA group to 11·5 (9·4–14·1) in the m1273 group. GMRs for wild-type cellular responses compared with controls ranged from 1·0 (95% CI 0·7–1·6) for half VLA to 4·7 (3·1–7·1) for m1273. The results were similar between those aged 30–69 years and those aged 70 years and older. Fatigue and pain were the most common solicited local and systemic adverse events, experienced more in people aged 30–69 years than those aged 70 years or older. Serious adverse events were uncommon, similar in active vaccine and control groups. In total, there were 24 serious adverse events: five in the control group (two in control group A, three in control group B, and zero in control group C), two in Ad26, five in VLA, one in VLA-half, one in BNT, two in BNT-half, two in ChAd, one in CVn, two in NVX, two in NVX-half, and one in m1273. Interpretation: All study vaccines boosted antibody and neutralising responses after ChAd/ChAd initial course and all except one after BNT/BNT, with no safety concerns. Substantial differences in humoral and cellular responses, and vaccine availability will influence policy choices for booster vaccination.

Despite the availability of vaccines, the high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy represents a significant challenge to public health, and raising vaccine acceptance among the public is critical. Although media has become an increasingly popular source of COVID-19 vaccine-related information, the question of whether and how media use is related to the public's vaccine hesitancy warrants exploration. Objective: This study aimed to (1) examine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, (2) identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and (3) explore the direct and indirect relationship between media use and vaccine hesitancy through psychological factors. Methods: A month before COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in South Korea, we conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey over 6 days (January 20-25, 2021). This study included 1016 participants, and a logit model for regression analyzed associations between sociodemographic factors, health-related factors, psychological factors, and media use toward one's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, we conducted a path analysis to examine the indirect effects of media use on vaccine hesitancy by using psychological factors (ie, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers of COVID-19 vaccination). Results: Among the participants (N=1016), 53.3% (541/1016) hesitated to take the COVID-19 vaccine, while 46.7% (475/1016) agreed to accept the vaccine. Of the sociodemographic factors, female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.967, 95% CI 1.36-2.86; P<.001), age in 50s (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.96; P=.004), and age over 60s (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.99; P=.04) were significant individual predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Perceived susceptibility of infection (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91; P=.01) and perceived benefits of vaccination (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91; P=.01) were associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Perceived barriers of vaccination (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.29-2.07; P<.001) and lower trust in government (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98; P=.04) were related to vaccine hesitancy. The use of offline and online media as sources for the perceived benefits of vaccination was associated with vaccine hesitancy, resulting in lower vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, perceived susceptibility of the disease and perceived barriers of vaccination mediated the association between social media use and vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Our findings revealed a considerable level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in South Korea. Gender-based and generation-based public health policies and communication are recommended. Efforts to lower the perceived risk of vaccine side effects and heighten perceived benefits of the vaccine are required. Although the use of media has a positive and negative effect on the population's vaccine hesitancy, efforts should be made to disseminate reliable and timely information on media while confronting misinformation or disinformation for successive implementation of vaccine programs during pandemics. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This exponential case rise was accompanied by an increase in the absolute number of case fatalities, with a corresponding strain on the public health sector. To effectively inform public health responses, policy and strategy to deal with the current wave and prepare for further waves, we discuss the drivers and challenges of control for this current wave and future waves, and offer practical recommendations. Vaccination will be the most important public health intervention to deal with the spread, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, therefore, efforts to fight vaccine hesitancy and build vaccine confidence and availability will be critical. Similarly, it will be important to build public health sector capacity and resilience to adequately deal with large-scale outbreaks and absorb the shock waves associated with such. Resuscitating and building the economy is an indispensable component of protecting public health. Therefore, collaborative efforts from relevant public health stakeholders, economists, politicians and other players are required to effectively coordinate the necessary responses and formulate the right policies and strategies. © Grant Murewanhema et al.","COVID-19; Pandemic; Vaccination; Waves; Zimbabwe","Capacity Building; Cooperative Behavior; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Policy; Humans; Public Health; Vaccination; Vaccination Refusal; Zimbabwe; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; fatigue; health care policy; human; morbidity; mortality; pandemic; population research; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; Zimbabwe; administration and dosage; capacity building; cooperation; epidemiology; prevention and control; public health; vaccination; vaccination refusal"

While questions of vaccine allocation strategies have received significant attention, important questions remain regarding the potential impact of the vaccine given uncertainties regarding efficacy against transmission, availability, timing, and durability. Methods: We adapted a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to examine the potential impact on hospitalization and mortality assuming increasing rates of vaccine efficacy, coverage, and administration. We also evaluated the uncertainty of the vaccine to prevent infectiousness as well as the impact on outcomes based on the timing of distribution and the potential effects of waning immunity. Findings: Increased vaccine efficacy against disease reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19; however, the relative benefit of transmission blocking varied depending on the timing of vaccine distribution. Early in an outbreak, a vaccine that reduces transmission will be relatively more effective than one introduced later in the outbreak. In addition, earlier and accelerated implementation of a less effective vaccine is more impactful than later implementation of a more effective vaccine. These findings are magnified when considering the durability of the vaccine. Vaccination in the spring will be less impactful when immunity is less durable. Interpretation: Policy choices regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and face mask use, will need to remain in place longer if the vaccine is less effective at reducing transmission or distributed slower. In addition, the stage of the local outbreak greatly impacts the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in a region and should be considered when allocating vaccines.

Globally, about 50% of countries have introduced HPV vaccination. Some LMIC with high burden of cervical cancer have not yet introduced HPV vaccination, or are reaching suboptimal vaccination coverage. While WHO issued a call for cervical cancer elimination in 2018, a global shortage of HPV vaccines is currently predicted to last at least until 2024. We reviewed national policies of EU/EEA countries and recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation to discuss current challenges and dose-sparing options. Several EU/EEA countries have extended HPV vaccination to boys and the European Cancer Organisation has issued a resolution for elimination of all HPV-associated cancers in both sexes. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control concluded in its 2020 guidance that cost-effectiveness of extending routine vaccination to boys depends on several context-specific factors. The extension of HPV vaccination to boys in EU/EEA countries may affect global availability of vaccines.

At some point after demonstration of substantial efficacy, placebo recipients should be offered the efficacious vaccine from their trial, which will occur before longer-term efficacy and safety are known. The absence of a placebo group could compromise assessment of longer-term vaccine effects. However, by continuing follow-up after vaccination of the placebo group, this study shows that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be mathematically derived by assuming that the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the original placebo recipients after their vaccination. Although this derivation provides less precise estimates than would be obtained by a standard trial where the placebo group remains unvaccinated, this proposed approach allows estimation of longer-term effect, including durability of vaccine efficacy and whether the vaccine eventually becomes harmful for some. Deferred vaccination, if done open-label, may lead to riskier behavior in the unblinded original vaccine group, confounding estimates of long-term vaccine efficacy. Hence, deferred vaccination via blinded crossover, where the vaccine group receives placebo and vice versa, would be the preferred way to assess vaccine durability and potential delayed harm. Deferred vaccination allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain them on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunologic and clinical effectiveness over time. © 2021 American College of Physicians.

Although influenza vaccination is recommended for health care workers, vaccination coverage is low. Methods This survey was conducted in the 2016/2017 and 2020/2021 influenza seasons. Questionnaires were sent to ED personnel in 12 hospitals in Bavaria, South-Eastern Germany. The response rates were 62% and 38% in 2016/2017 and 2020/2021, respectively. Data were compared between the two seasons as well as between vaccinated and not vaccinated respondents in 2020/2021. Results Significantly more ED personnel reported having been vaccinated in the 2020/2021 season. Factors associated with vaccination coverage (or the intention to get vaccinated) were profession (physician / medical student), having been vaccinated at least twice, the availability of an influenza vaccination on site (in the ED) as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, significant differences in the assessment and evaluation of influenza, its vaccination side effects and ethical aspects were found between vaccinated and not vaccinated ED personnel in 2020/2021. Unvaccinated respondents estimated higher frequencies of almost all potential vaccination side effects, were less likely to accept lay-offs if employees would not come to work during an influenza pandemic and more likely to agree that work attendance should be an employee´s decision. Vaccinated participants instead, rather agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and were less likely to consider job changes in case of a mandatory vaccination policy. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to a higher influenza vaccination rate among ED workers. Vaccination on site and interventions targeting the perception of influenza vaccination and its side effects may be most promising to increase the vaccination coverage among ED personnel.

Although COVID-19 severely impacted the Brazilian health care system, it is crucial to further characterize the degree of disruption caused to public health efforts, in order to address and manage long term effects of this pandemic. We therefore quantified the demand for preventive and treatment services from the Brazilian Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde/SUS) in 2020 to evaluate potential repercussions of COVID-19 in this setting. Methods: Using the SUS database, we compared preventative and treatment services rendered in 2020 to the same services rendered from 2017 to 19. We also evaluated the frequency of respiratory infection (RI) diagnoses during the pandemic, relative to the preceding years. Results: Compared to 2017–19, in 2020 non-urgent medical appointments decreased 1.4-fold (p = 0.0017), dental consultations 2.8-fold (p = 0.05), and immunization coverage 1.5 fold (p = 0.0005). The number of RI visits to SUS ambulatory care units in 2020 was 4.2 times higher than in preceding years (p = 0.0014), with a peak of 280,898 diagnoses in July 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have led to a dramatic decline in preventative and treatment services provided by SUS to the Brazilian population. Our findings may aid decision-makers in formulating policies to increase the availability of outpatient services in the aftermath of the pandemic. Counter measures will be critical to avoid a resurgence in vaccine-preventable diseases and complications stemming from non-communicable, chronic health conditions. © 2021","COVID-19; Immunization; Public health; Public policy; Vaccination","Brazil; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination Coverage; Article; Brazil; Brazilian; coronavirus disease 2019; health service; human; infection prevention; pandemic; respiratory tract infection; risk factor; trend study; vaccination coverage; epidemiology; pandemic"

To secure the full benefits of mass vaccination, which started in early January 2021, it is of utmost importance to complement it with mid-term non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The objective was to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until 15 February 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from 15 February 2021 to 30 June 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed for the first phase: (a) A baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs in January 2021; (b) a “semi-lockdown” scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing, and social distancing/teleworking in January 2021; and (c) a “rolling lock-down” scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the “semi-lockdown” scenario clearly outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities); the second phase is extremely sensitive on the availability of sufficient vaccine supplies and high vaccination rates. © 2021 by the au-thors.

We simulate the virus spread on campus, comparing SIR and SEIR models, and examine how different course policies can affect the number of infected students. We demonstrate that we can achieve a safer environment on campus by moving a certain number of courses with the highest centrality values. Additionally, we analyze how the student flow rate can help reduce the R0 value representing the metric of how many other people an infected individual could infect.

This longitudinal serological study evaluated the magnitude and potency of the endogenous antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination in participants who first received a COVID-19 monoclonal antibody in a prevention study. Over the course of 6 months, serum samples were collected from a population of nursing home residents and staff enrolled in a clinical trial who were randomized to either bamlanivimab treatment or placebo. In an unplanned component of this trial, a subset of these participants was subsequently fully vaccinated with two doses of either SpikeVax (Moderna) or Comirnaty (BioNTech/ Pfizer) COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. This post hoc analysis assessed the immune response to vaccination for 135 participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody titers and potency were assessed using three assays against SARS-CoV-2 proteins that bamlanivimab does not efficiently bind to, thereby reflecting the endogenous antibody response. All bamlanivimab and placebo recipients mounted a robust immune response to full COVID-19 vaccination, irrespective of age, risk category, and vaccine type with any observed differences of uncertain clinical importance. These findings are pertinent for informing public health policy with results that suggest that the benefit of receiving COVID-19 vaccination at the earliest opportunity outweighs the minimal effect on the endogenous immune response due to prior prophylactic COVID-19 monoclonal antibody infusion.

An online survey was conducted among adults in Israel (n = 461), immediately after the first COVID-19 vaccine became available (22 December 2020 to 10 January 2021). Two regressions were performed to investigate determinants of intention to receive the available COVID-19 vaccine and sense of urgency to receive the vaccine. Although many adults were willing to receive available COVID-19 vaccine, only 65% were willing to immediately receive the vaccine, 17% preferred to wait 3 months and 18% preferred to wait a year. The sense of urgency to get vaccinated differed by age, periphery level, perceived barriers, cues to action and availability. Incentives such as monetary rewards or the green pass did not increase the probability of getting vaccination immediately. Providing data on the role of incentives in increasing the intention to immediately receive the available COVID-19 vaccine is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers. Our findings underscore the importance of COVID-19 vaccine accessibility. Health policy makers should consider allocating funds for making the vaccine accessible and encourage methods of persuasion, instead of investing funds in monetary incentives. © 2022 by the author.

Traditionally, port terminals specializing in cruise shipping generated localized traffic peaks that impacted on the management of urban mobility in port cities, and this created a major difficulty in the city-port relationship. The health crisis caused by COVID-19 has had a very strong impact on the cruise sector which reached its maximum in the volume of passengers in 2019 and practically disappeared during the following year, with reduction rates higher than ninety percent. Through indicators analysis, this paper will examine the impacts of cruise shipping on urban mobility in Spanish Mediterranean port cities (Alicante, Almeria, Barcelona, Malaga, Palma de Mallorca, Tarragona and Valencia), and on the mobility planning measures proposed and developed to mitigate these impacts. Due to data availability, the year 2018 will be considered to evaluate the general impact of cruise traffic on urban population and urban mobility characteristics. With an expected stabilization of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spanish tourist industry and the associated cruise shipping activity face the greatest challenge in their history: reactivation. International sanitary measures and mass vaccination are allowing a new normality to emerge. Therefore, the reopening of services associated with the cruise shipping industry is starting to be announced, with the appropriate promotion of public policies, in order to achieve the sector's revitalization. This expected return to pre-pandemic figures for cruise shipping traffic is a challenging scenario in Spanish Mediterranean port-cities, where the indicated measures and new urban mobility management for the future should be explored and considered.  © 2021 WIT Press.","COVID-19; Cruise shipping; Mediterranean Spain; Port-city relationships; Public policies; Urban mobility",""

We find that vaccine information reduces peoples’ voluntary social distancing, adherence to hygiene guidelines, and their willingness to stay at home. Getting positive information on COVID-19 vaccines induces people to believe in a swifter return to normal life. The results indicate an important behavioral drawback of successful vaccine development: An increased focus on vaccines can lower compliance with public health guidelines and accelerate the spread of infectious disease. The results imply that, as vaccinations roll out and the end of a pandemic feels closer, policies aimed at increasing social distancing will be less effective, and stricter policies might be required. © 2021 The Author(s)","Economic epidemiology; Information; Public health communication; Social distancing; Vaccination; Vaccine information","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; COVID-19; disease spread; epidemiology; health policy; infectious disease; public health; vaccination; vaccine; anticipation; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug information; drug safety; health behavior; health care availability; human; pandemic; protocol compliance; social distancing; Swedish citizen; vaccination"

The aim of this study is to examine the opinion that specific demographic groups have about COVID-19 vaccination, in order to detect potential fears and reasons for negative attitudes towards vaccination, and to gain knowledge on how to prepare strategies to eliminate possible misinformation that could affect vaccine hesitancy. The data collection approach was based on online questionnaire surveys, divided into three groups of questions that followed the main postulates of the health belief theory—a theory that helps understanding a behaviour of the public in some concrete surrounding in receiving preventive measures. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the influence of individual factors on refusing the vaccine, and to provide information on the perception of participants on the danger of COVID-19 infection, and on potential barriers that could retard the vaccine utility. There was an equal proportion of participants (total number 276) who planned on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (37%), and of those who did not (36.3%). The rest (26.7%) of participants were still indecisive. Our results indicated that attitudes on whether to receive the vaccine, on how serious consequences might be if getting the infection, as well as a suspicious towards the vaccine efficacy and the fear of the vaccine potential side effects, may depend on participants’ age (<40 vs. >40 years) and on whether they are healthcare workers or not. The barriers that make participants‘ unsure about of receiving the vaccine, such as a distrust in the vaccine efficacy and safety, may vary in different socio-demographic groups and depending on which is the point of time in the course of the pandemic development, as well as on the vaccine availability and experience in using certain vaccine formulas. There is a pressing need for health services to continuously provide information to the general population, and to address the root causes of mistrust through improved communication, using a wide range of policies, interventions and technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, we study how the COVID-19 epidemics evolves and how it is contained by different vaccination scenarios by taking into account data showing that older people, as well as individuals with comorbidities and poor metabolic health, and people coming from economically depressed areas with lower quality of life in general, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and quicker loss of immunity and are therefore more prone to reinfection. Our results reveal that the structure and the spatial arrangement of subpopulations are important epidemiological determinants. In a healthier society the disease spreads more rapidly but the consequences are less disastrous as in a society with more prevalent chronic comorbidities. If individuals with poor health are segregated within one community, the epidemic outcome is less favorable. Moreover, we show that, contrary to currently widely adopted vaccination policies, prioritizing elderly and other higher-risk groups is beneficial only if the supply of vaccine is high. If, however, the vaccination availability is limited, and if the demographic distribution across the social network is homogeneous, better epidemic outcomes are achieved if healthy people are vaccinated first. Only when higher-risk groups are segregated, like in elderly homes, their prioritization will lead to lower COVID-19 related deaths. Accordingly, young and healthy individuals should view vaccine uptake as not only protecting them, but perhaps even more so protecting the more vulnerable socio-demographic groups. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agent-based simulation; COVID-19; Epidemic model; Metabolic disease; Population heterogeneity; Social network; Socio-demographic structure; Vaccination strategy",""

Despite the efforts of United States healthcare providers to vaccinate the bulk of its population, vaccine hesitancy is still a severe challenge that has led to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases to over 100,000 people during early August 2021. To our knowledge, there are limited nationwide studies that examined the spatial distribution of vaccination rates, mainly based on the social vulnerability index (SVI). In this study, we compiled a database of the percentage of fully vaccinated people at the county scale across the continental United States as of 29 July 2021, along with SVI data as potential significant covariates. We further employed multiscale geographically weighted regression to model spatial nonstationarity of vaccination rates. Our findings indicated that the model could explain over 79% of the variance of vaccination rate based on Per capita income and Minority (%) (with positive impacts), and Age 17 and younger (%), Mobile homes (%), and Uninsured people (%) (with negative effects). However, the impact of each covariate varied for different counties due to using separate optimal bandwidths.

Overarching challenges include: under-detection and under-reporting of child and adolescent TB; poor implementation and reporting of contact investigation and TB preventive treatment services; the need for health systems strengthening to deliver effective, decentralized services; and lack of integration between TB programs and child health services. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on case detection and treatment outcomes. Child and adolescent TB working groups can address country-specific challenges to close the policy– practice gaps by developing and supporting decentral ized models of care, strengthening clinical and laboratory diagnosis, including of multidrug-resistant TB, providing recommended options for treatment of disease and infection, and forging strong collaborations across relevant health sectors. © 2022 by the authors.

Healthcare systems have no option other than being supported by the participation of young and motivated healthcare providers (HCPs) in their undergraduate medical studies during their prevention and control internship program during the outbreak. Understanding key motivation factors influencing HCPs are vital to ensure their effective participation in such situations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 410 undergraduate medical students at Qassim University in Saudi Arabia with the aim to describe the motivation factors that affect their willingness to volunteer during a pandemic. An online survey questionnaire was conducted. RESULTS: 410 participants of which 239 (58.29%) were female, 108 (26.34%) were in their third academic year and 129 (31.46%) were between 21-22 years of age. More than 70% of participants showed willingness to volunteer during a pandemic. Their willingness to volunteer was motivated by distance of workplace to home, availability of transportation, being vaccinated, access to health care for self and family if affected, and provision of specialized training. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare administrators and policy makers need to address these factors effectively to ensure the availability of skilled and motivated healthcare providers during a pandemic. © 2022 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

Targeted quarantine can reduce the amount of indiscriminate social distancing needed to control transmission. Finding the optimal balance between targeted versus broad-scale policies can be operationalized by minimizing the total amount of social isolation needed to achieve a target reproductive number. Optimality is achieved by quarantining on the basis of a risk threshold that depends strongly on current disease prevalence, suggesting that very different disease control policies should be used at different times or places. Aggressive quarantine is warranted given low disease prevalence, while populations with a higher base rate of infection should rely more on social distancing by all. The total value of a quarantine policy rises as case counts fall, is relatively insensitive to vaccination unless the vaccinated are exempt from distancing policies, and is substantially increased by the availability of modestly more information about individual risk of infectiousness.  © 2021 The Authors.","control theory; economic epidemiology; exposure notification; risk management; SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Prevalence; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Disease control; Diseases; Economics; Risk management; Economic epidemiology; Economic values; Exposure notification; Infectious disease; Influenza pandemics; Optimal balance; Reproductive number; Risks management; SARS-CoV-2; Social isolation; Article; basic reproduction number; disease notification; disease transmission; economic aspect; effective reproduction number; health care cost; health economics; human; infection risk; low risk patient; mathematical analysis; medical information; prevalence; quarantine; risk assessment; risk factor; risk management; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social behavior; social distancing; social isolation; vaccination; pandemic; prevalence; SARS"

In consequence, most governments have taken action to promote access to water and sanitation services for all. This paper documents an overview of initiatives and interventions that countries have implemented during the first months of the COVID-19 response. Initiatives have been identified across 84 countries worldwide, and categorized into those that aimed at securing water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for all, and those that sought to provide technical and financial support to service providers. The pandemic has not hit countries in the same way. Accordingly, results show disparities in the response between and within regions, with the level of activity found in the countries varying largely in terms of ambition and scope. Hygiene promotion and infection prevention and control (IPC) has been widely adopted – at least one response measure found in 94% of mapped countries -, although not always matched in ambition with the assured availability of soap, water, and handwashing facilities. Support to vulnerable households to promote basic access to WASH services at scale was weak (38% of countries) or implemented locally (25%), and requiring additional focus, particularly in rural areas and small towns. In addition, parallel support needs to be extended to service providers or to households themselves in the form of cash transfers, in order to ensure the financial viability and the continuity of services. All lessons learned distilled from the pandemic should help strengthen the enabling environment for more resilient services in future emergencies. Areas for focus could include developing specific pandemic response strategies and plans; strengthening coordination; and establishing emergency financial support mechanisms for water operators, for example. Overall, findings presented herein contribute to enhance current and future pandemics prevention, mitigation, and recovery. © 2021 The Authors","COVID-19; Hygiene; Low-income countries; Response measures; Water and sanitation","COVID-19; Government; Humans; Hygiene; Pandemics; Sanitation; SARS-CoV-2; Water; Water Supply; Emergency services; Finance; chlorine; hand sanitizer; water; COVID-19; Financial support; Government regulators; Hygiene; Low income countries; Response measures; Service provider; Water and sanitation; Water sanitation; Water service; COVID-19; disease control; epidemic; health policy; hygiene; low income population; policy implementation; rural population; sanitation; Article; awareness; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; disease surveillance; disease transmission; disinfection; education; environmental sanitation; geographic distribution; government; hand washing; health care facility; health care utilization; human; infection control; Internet; knowledge; language; migrant worker; public health; reproductive health; rural area; sanitation; social distancing; social media; vaccination; virus transmission; work environment; government; hygiene; pandemic; water supply; Sanitation"

In the past, despite an impressive record of vaccine effectiveness in the United States, several factors have contributed to a decreased acceptance of vaccines that has resulted in outbreaks of infectious diseases, e.g., measles. More recently, vaccine hesitancy has spread to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. There are many causes of vaccine hesitancy, such as misinformation, fallacies, and myths, that have contributed to vaccine hesitancy. Objective: The purpose of the present report is to address the many causes of vaccine hesitancy and to suggest ways that the allergist/immunologist can be involved in the promotion of vaccine acceptance. Methods: The current COVID-19 vaccines were reviewed, together with their mechanisms(s) of action and adverse reactions to them. Results: The many causes of vaccine hesitancy include many doubts and concerns related to COVID-19 vaccines as well as a diminished level of confidence and trust by segments of the public in the nation's leaders in government, medical, and business communities, that those groups once enjoyed. Conclusion: Vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines is the only way that COVID-19 will be eliminated or at least controlled today, and vaccine hesitancy is the potential nemesis. The present report describes how the allergist/immunologist not only plays a major role in the delivery of specialized therapy of COVID-19 but also in educating the public with regard to the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, in dispelling misinformation, and in promoting trust for vaccine acceptance but must be informed with the most accurate and current information to do so.

This event presents major challenges for the Kingdom’s public health sector, which strives to decrease the burden of infectious diseases and to adequately control their spread both in KSA and pilgrims home nations. The aims of the study were to assess preventative measures practice, including vaccination history and health education, among Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional survey was administered to pilgrims from February to April 2019 at the departure lounge at King Abdul Aziz International airport, Jeddah city. The questionnaire comprised questions on sociodemographic information (age, gender, marital status, level of education, history of vaccinations and chronic illnesses), whether the pilgrim had received any health education and orientation prior to coming to Saudi Arabia or on their arrival, and their experiences with preventative practices. Results: Pilgrims (n = 1012) of 41 nationalities completed the survey. Chronic diseases were reported among pilgrims (n = 387, 38.2%) with cardiovascular diseases being the most reported morbidity (n = 164, 42.3%). The majority of pilgrims had been immunized prior to travel to Saudi Arabia (n = 770, 76%). The most commonly reported immunizations were influenza (n = 514, 51%), meningitis (n = 418, 41%), and Hepatitis B virus vaccinations (n = 310, 31%). However, 242 (24%) had not received any vaccinations prior to travel, including meningitis vaccine and poliomyelitis vaccine, which are mandatory by Saudi Arabian health authorities for pilgrims coming from polio active countries. Nearly a third of pilgrims (n = 305; 30.1%) never wore a face mask in crowded areas during Umrah in 2019. In contrast, similar numbers said they always wore a face mask (n = 351, 34.6%) in crowded areas, while 63.2% reported lack of availability of face masks during Umrah. The majority of participants had received some form of health education on preventative measures, including hygiene aspects (n = 799, 78.9%), mostly in their home countries (n = 450, 44.4%). A positive association was found between receiving health education and practicing of preventative measures, such as wearing face masks in crowded areas (p = 0.04), and other health practice scores (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Although the experiences of the preventative measures among pilgrims in terms of health education, vaccinations, and hygienic practices were at times positive, this study identified several issues. These included the following preventative measures: Immunizations, particularly meningitis and poliomyelitis vaccine, and using face masks in crowded areas. The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for further studies that focus on development of accessible health education in a form that engages pilgrims to promote comprehensive preventative measures during Umrah and Hajj and other religious pilgrimages. © 2020 by the authors.

There is therefore growing optimism around the world about their future availability and effectiveness. However, supplies are likely to be limited and restricted to certain categories of individuals, at least initially. Thus, governments have suggested prioritization schemes to allocate such limited supplies. The majority of such schemes are said to be developed to safeguard the weakest sections of society; that is, healthcare personnel and the elderly. Methods: In this work, we analyse three case studies (incarcerated people; homeless people, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants). We propose a bioethical argument that frames the discussion by describing the salient facts about each of the three populations and then argue that these characteristics entail inclusion and prioritization in the queue for vaccination in their country of residence. Results: Through an analysis informed by ethical considerations revolving around the concepts of fairness and equality, we try to raise awareness of these important issues among decision makers. Conclusion: Our goal is to advocate for the development of more inclusive policies and frameworks in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation and, in general, in all scenarios in which there is a shortage of optimal care and treatments. © Copyright © 2021 Farina and Lavazza.","equity; ethical framework; inclusion; marginalized populations; vaccine distribution","Aged; Consumer Advocacy; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Care Rationing; Humans; Refugees; Social Marginalization; Vaccination; Vulnerable Populations; administration and dosage; aged; consumer advocacy; epidemiology; health care organization; human; organization and management; prevention and control; refugee; social exclusion; vaccination; vulnerable population"

Methods:The vaccination strategies are defined by solving optimal control problems of a compartmental epidemic model in which the daily vaccination rate and the daily testing rate for the identification and isolation of asymptomatic subjects are the control variables. Different kinds of algebraic constraints are considered, representing different vaccination scenarios in which the total amount of vaccines available during the time period under consideration is limited or the number of daily available vaccines is limited. These optimal control problems are numerically solved by means of a direct transcription technique, which allows both equality and inequality constraints to be straightforwardly included in the formulation of the optimal control problems. Results:Several numerical experiments are conducted, in which the objective functional to be minimized is a combination of the number of symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious subjects with the cost of vaccination of susceptible subjects and testing of asymptomatic infectious subjects. The results confirm the hypothesis that the implementation of early control measures significantly reduces the number of symptomatic infected subjects, which is a key aspect for the resilience of the healthcare system. The sensitivity analysis of the solutions to the weighting parameters of the objective functional reveals that it is possible to obtain a vaccination strategy that allows vaccination supplies to be saved while keeping the same number of symptomatic infected subjects. Furthermore, it indicates that if the vaccination plan is not supported by a sufficient rate of testing, the number of symptomatic infected subjects could increase. Finally, the sensitivity analysis shows that a significant reduction in the efficacy of the vaccines could also lead to a relevant increase in the number of symptomatic infected subjects. Conclusions:The numerical experiments show that the proposed approach, which is based on optimal control of compartmental epidemic models, provides healthcare systems with a suitable method for scheduling vaccination plans and testing policies to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. © 2021","COVID-19 transmission dynamics; Epidemic compartmental model; Optimal control; Sensitivity analysis; Vaccination and testing strategies","COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; Constraint theory; Disease control; Diseases; Numerical methods; Optimal control systems; Sensitivity analysis; Viruses; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; Compartmental modelling; COVID-19 transmission dynamic; Epidemic compartmental model; Epidemic modeling; Numerical experiments; Optimal control problem; Optimal controls; Testing strategies; Transmission dynamics; Vaccination strategy; Article; compartment model; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; health care cost; human; infection control; isolation; nonhuman; sensitivity analysis; vaccination; virus transmission; vaccination; Vaccines"

This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on routine immunisation using triangulated data from global, country-based, and individual-reported sources obtained during the pandemic period. Methods: This report synthesised data from 170 countries and territories. Data sources included administered vaccine-dose data from January to December, 2019, and January to December, 2020, WHO regional office reports, and a WHO-led pulse survey administered in April, 2020, and June, 2020. Results were expressed as frequencies and proportions of respondents or reporting countries. Data on vaccine doses administered were weighted by the population of surviving infants per country. Findings: A decline in the number of administered doses of diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus-containing vaccine (DTP3) and first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in the first half of 2020 was noted. The lowest number of vaccine doses administered was observed in April, 2020, when 33% fewer DTP3 doses were administered globally, ranging from 9% in the WHO African region to 57% in the South-East Asia region. Recovery of vaccinations began by June, 2020, and continued into late 2020. WHO regional offices reported substantial disruption to routine vaccination sessions in April, 2020, related to interrupted vaccination demand and supply, including reduced availability of the health workforce. Pulse survey analysis revealed that 45 (69%) of 65 countries showed disruption in outreach services compared with 27 (44%) of 62 countries with disrupted fixed-post immunisation services. Interpretation: The marked magnitude and global scale of immunisation disruption evokes the dangers of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in the future. Trends indicating partial resumption of services highlight the urgent need for ongoing assessment of recovery, catch-up vaccination strategy implementation for vulnerable populations, and ensuring vaccine coverage equity and health system resilience.

Methods: Descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional design was used. A convenience sample of 140 Jordanian healthcare providers working in COVID-19 units from governmental hospitals completed the study during February–March 2021. A self-reported measure with three domains: knowledge (e.g., COVID-19 transmissions), attitudes (e.g., COVID-19 vaccination), and practices (e.g., handwashing) were used. An independent t-test was performed to assess the difference in knowledge, attitude, and practice depending on demographic and work-related variables, while Pearson r and multiple linear regression were performed to identify the relationships between the study variables and the predictors of COVID-19 preventive practices. Results: The majority of the participants had good knowledge (81.4%), good attitude (87.1%), and satisfactory practice (77.9%). Knowledge was significantly associated with attitude and practice (p <.01), and attitude was significantly associated with practice (p <.01). There was a statistically significant difference in knowledge, attitude, and practice depending on the existence of infection control policy, availability of PPE, and receiving infection control training (p <.05). Predictors of COVID-19 practice included knowledge and attitude, PPE availability, and receiving training on infection control (p <.05). Conclusion: This result might suggest that there are some gaps between knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19 preventive measures. Lack of PPE and inadequate infection control training could contribute to this gap. © The Author(s) 2022.","COVID-19 pandemic; KAP survey; or healthcare services; PPE",""

Moreover, they present role models for communities with regards to attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Hence, hesitancy of HCWs towards vaccination can crucially affect the efforts aiming to contain the pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to HCWs in Arab countries, which have a population of over 440 million. Objectives: To assess the rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside Arab countries, and their perceived barriers towards vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on an online survey was conducted from 14–29 January 2021, targeting Arabic-speaking HCWs from all around the world. Results: The survey recruited 5708 eligible participants (55.6% males, 44.4% females, age 30.6 ± 10 years) from 21 Arab countries (87.5%) and 54 other countries (12.5%). Our analysis showed a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside of Arab countries (25.8% and 32.8%, respectively). The highest rates of hesitancy were among participants from the western regions of the Arab world (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria). The most cited reasons for hesitancy were concerns about side effects and distrust of the expedited vaccine production and healthcare policies. Factors associated with higher hesitancy included age of 30–59, previous or current suspected or confirmed COVID-19, female gender, not knowing the vaccine type authorized in the participant’s country, and not regularly receiving the influenza vaccine. Conclusion: This is the first large-scale multinational post-vaccine-availability study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs. It reveals high rates of hesitancy among Arab-speaking HCWs. Unless addressed properly, this hesitancy can impede the efforts for achieving widespread vaccination and collective immunity. © 2021 by the authors.

We use official reported data retrieved from Shanghai municipal Health Commissions to estimate the incidence of infections, severe/critical infections, and deaths to assess the disease burden. By adjusting for right censoring and RT-PCR sensitivity, we provide estimates of clinical severity, including the infection fatality ratio, symptomatic case fatality ratio, and risk of developing severe/critical disease upon infection. The overall infection rate, severe/critical infection rate, and mortality rate were 2.74 (95% CI: 2.73-2.74) per 100 individuals, 6.34 (95% CI: 6.02-6.66) per 100,000 individuals and 2.42 (95% CI: 2.23-2.62) per 100,000 individuals, respectively. The severe/critical infection rate and mortality rate increased with age, noted in individuals aged 80 years or older. The overall fatality ratio and risk of developing severe/critical disease upon infection were 0.09% (95% CI: 0.09-0.10%) and 0.27% (95% CI: 0.24-0.29%), respectively. Having received at least one vaccine dose led to a 10-fold reduction in the risk of death for infected individuals aged 80 years or older. Under the repeated population-based screenings and strict intervention policies implemented in Shanghai, our results found a lower disease burden and mortality of the outbreak compared to other settings and countries, showing the impact of the successful outbreak containment in Shanghai. The estimated low clinical severity of this Omicron BA.2 epidemic in Shanghai highlight the key contribution of vaccination and availability of hospital beds to reduce the risk of death. © 2022 The Author(s).

Methods: After analyzing the pandemic strategies of the major organizations and countries and with a literature review conducted by a core panel, a modified Delphi survey was administered to 13 experts in the fields of vaccination, infectious disease, and public health in the Republic of Korea. The following topics were discussed: 1) identifying the objectives of the vaccination strategy, 2) identifying allocation criteria, and 3) establishing a step-by-step vaccination framework and prioritization strategy based on the allocation criteria. Two rounds of surveys were conducted for each topic, with a structured questionnaire provided via e-mail in the first round. After analyzing the responses, a meeting with the experts was held to obtain consensus on how to prioritize the population groups. Results: The first objective of the vaccination strategy was maintenance of the integrity of the healthcare system and critical infrastructure, followed by reduction of morbidity and mortality and reduction of community transmission. In the initial phase, older adult residents in care homes, high-risk health and social care workers, and personal support workers who work in direct contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients would be prioritized. Expansion of vaccine supply would allow immunization of older adults not included in phase 1, followed by healthcare workers not previously included and individuals with comorbidities. Further widespread vaccine supply would ensure availability to the extended adult age groups (50–64 years old), critical workers outside the health sector, residents who cannot socially distance, and, eventually, the remaining populations. Conclusion: This survey provides the much needed insight into the decision-making process for vaccine allocation at the national level. However, flexibility in adapting to strategies will be essential, as new information is constantly emerging. © 2021 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

The gradient in health has become more pronounced in the COVID-19 crisis considering discrepancies in disease prevalence, geographical accessibility, availability, affordability, quality/safety of health services, and human resources. Through PubMed, GoogleScholar, Scopus, WHO, OECD, and UN databases, the English documents and global statistics were collected. Determining the role of health equity-related factors and introducing mechanisms to maintain regional and international justice in health, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, were among the core concepts of this paper. Social determinants of health (SDH), interregional and intraregional bodies are the main drivers of discrimination in health services. Governments should relish chief health strategists’ role in possessing legitimacy, accountability, direction, transparent performance, fairness, and good governance in one word. Improving health literacy and telemedicine, providing income support, and reforming insurance where needed, are other national mechanisms to amend inequity. Among interregional issues, what is concerning is the matter of sanctions on access to health services, which is against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Shortage of vital medications, ventilators, test kits, COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical raw materials, foreign currency, decreased national currency value, purchasing power parity, and quality/safety of health services resulted from such oppression. The article also provides practical suggestions, paving the way for re-establishing global solidarity and developing health justice in deprived regions. © 2021, Briefland.

Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health. In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP&R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs). However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives. There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health interventions, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety. Objective: Develop a Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) Framework and recommendations for pharmacy professional pathways towards full integration within public health EP&R efforts (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and enhanced recognition of pharmacists’ skills, roles and contributions as integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team. Methods: This paper draws on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) 2003 Statement on the Role of Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness and lessons learned from previous and current public health emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide expanded guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy professionals across all practice settings in EP&R. The proposed PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations’ Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Guidance, health departments and emergency preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions. Results: Based on methods and resources utilized in developing this proposed PEPR Framework, five key focus areas were identified, as follows: 1) Emergency preparedness and response 2) Operations management 3) Patient care and population health interventions 4) Public health pharmacy education and continuing professional education 5) Evaluation, research, and dissemination for impact and outcomes Conclusion: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements. Recommendations to enhance pharmacy's scope as public health professionals involved in EP&R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking. Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams. Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP&R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals' contribution and value during public health emergencies. The proposed PEPR Framework can be utilized to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate results in order to strengthen existing efforts and to establish new initiatives in EP&R. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Disaster Management; Emergency Preparedness and Response; Pandemic; Pharmacists; Pharmacy professionals; Provider status; Public health emergency; Public Health Pharmacy","Civil Defense; Community Pharmacy Services; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Pharmacists; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Professional Role; Public Health; civil defense; epidemiology; human; pandemic; pharmacist; pharmacy (shop); practice guideline; prevention and control; professional standard; public health"

As vaccinations are globally introduced into the repertoire of available interventions, it is important to consider how changes in the local supply of vaccines, including delays in administration, may be addressed through existing policy levers. This study aims to identify the optimal level of interventions for COVID-19 from 2021 to 2022 in the Philippines, which as a developing country is particularly vulnerable to shifting assumptions around vaccine availability. Furthermore, we explore optimal strategies in scenarios featuring delays in vaccine administration, expansions of vaccine supply, and limited combinations of interventions. Methods: Embedding our work within the local policy landscape, we apply optimal control theory to the compartmental model of COVID-19 used by the Philippine government’s pandemic surveillance platform and introduce four controls: (a) precautionary measures like community quarantines, (b) detection of asymptomatic cases, (c) detection of symptomatic cases, and (d) vaccinations. The model is fitted to local data using an L-BFGS minimization procedure. Optimality conditions are identified using Pontryagin’s minimum principle and numerically solved using the forward–backward sweep method. Results: Simulation results indicate that early and effective implementation of both precautionary measures and symptomatic case detection is vital for averting the most infections at an efficient cost, resulting in > 99 % reduction of infections compared to the no-control scenario. Expanding vaccine administration capacity to 440,000 full immunizations daily will reduce the overall cost of optimal strategy by 25 % , while allowing for a faster relaxation of more resource-intensive interventions. Furthermore, delays in vaccine administration require compensatory increases in the remaining policy levers to maintain a minimal number of infections. For example, delaying the vaccines by 180 days (6 months) will result in an 18 % increase in the cost of the optimal strategy. Conclusion: We conclude with practical insights regarding policy priorities particularly attuned to the Philippine context, but also applicable more broadly in similar resource-constrained settings. We emphasize three key takeaways of (a) sustaining efficient case detection, isolation, and treatment strategies; (b) expanding not only vaccine supply but also the capacity to administer them, and; (c) timeliness and consistency in adopting policy measures.

Objectives: To evaluate trends and disparities in access to pharmacies in 4 largest cities in the United States, New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, and Chicago, by neighborhood racial and ethnic composition from 2015 to 2020. Methods: Data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (2015-2020) and the American Community Survey (2015-2019) were used. We examined neighborhoods (i.e., census tracts) and evaluated disparities in “pharmacy deserts” (low-income neighborhoods (1) whose average distance to the nearest pharmacy was at least 1 mile or (2) whose average distance to the nearest pharmacy was at least 0.5 mile and at least 100 households had no vehicle access). We also evaluated the differences in pharmacy closures and the availability of pharmacy services. Results: From 2015 to 2020, the percent of neighborhoods with pharmacy deserts declined in New York City (from 1.6% to 0.9% of neighborhoods, P < 0.01), remained stable in Los Angeles (13.7% to 13.4%, P = 0.58) and Houston (27.0% to 28.5%, P = 0.18), and increased in Chicago (15.0% to 19.9%, P < 0.01). Pharmacy deserts were persistently more common in Black and Latino neighborhoods in all 4 cities. As of 2020, pharmacies in Black and Latino neighborhoods were also more likely to close and less likely to offer immunization, 24-hour, and drive-through services than pharmacies in other neighborhoods. Conclusion: To reduce disparities in access to medications and health care services, including those in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (e.g., testing and vaccinations), policies that improve pharmacy access and expand the provision of pharmacy services in minority neighborhoods are critical. © 2021 American Pharmacists Association®","","Chicago; COVID-19; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Los Angeles; New York City; Pharmaceutical Services; Pharmacies; SARS-CoV-2; United States; prescription drug; Article; Black person; California; health care access; health care planning; health disparity; Hispanic; hospital department; household; human; Illinois; immunization; lowest income group; neighborhood; New York; pharmacy (shop); trend study; health care delivery; United States"

Method: A cross-national survey was conducted in both China and the United States, and discrete choice experiments, as well as Likert scales, were utilized to assess vaccine preference and the underlying factors contributing to vaccination acceptance. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to enable a direct comparison between the two countries. Results: A total of 9077 (5375 and 3702 from China and the United States, respectively) respondents completed the survey. After propensity score matching, over 82.0% of respondents from China positively accepted the COVID-19 vaccination, while 72.2% of respondents from the United States positively accepted it. Specifically, only 31.9% of Chinese respondents were recommended by a doctor to have COVID-19 vaccination, while more than half of the U.S. respondents were recommended by a doctor (50.2%), local health board (59.4%), or friends and families (64.8%). The discrete choice experiments revealed that respondents from the United States attached the greatest importance to the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (44.41%), followed by the cost of vaccination (29.57%), whereas those from China held a different viewpoint, that the cost of vaccination covered the largest proportion in their tradeoff (30.66%), and efficacy ranked as the second most important attribute (26.34%). Additionally, respondents from China tended to be much more concerned about the adverse effect of vaccination (19.68% vs. 6.12%) and have a lower perceived severity of being infected with COVID-19. Conclusion: Although the overall acceptance and hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccination in both countries are high, underpinned distinctions between these countries were observed. Owing to the differences in COVID-19 incidence rates, cultural backgrounds, and the availability of specific COVID-19 vaccines in the two countries, vaccine rollout strategies should be nation-dependent. © 2021 by the authors.

We wanted to identify which socio-demographic, socio-economic, personal health and psychological factors were associated with COVID-19 vaccine intentions (CVI) in adults living in England who did not want, yet to consider, or not sure whether to vaccinate. In October/November 2020, prior to vaccine availability, we surveyed adults stratified by gender, region, and deprivation, with additional purposive sampling of those aged 50 and over and those from an ethnic minority. Two hundred and ten did not want; 407 had yet to consider; and 1,043 were not sure whether to be vaccinated. Factors positively associated with CVI were: favorable vaccine views, trust in institutions associated with vaccine approval, vaccine subjective norms, anticipated regret of not having a vaccine, perceived vaccine benefits, perceived safety knowledge sufficiency, and a history of having an influenza vaccine. Factors negatively associated were: anti-lockdown views, and being a health or social care worker. Whilst showing significant relationships with CVI when analyzed in isolation, neighborhood deprivation and ethnicity did show an independent relationship to intention when all study measures were controlled for. Our findings suggest vaccine promotion focusing on the anticipated regret of not having a vaccine, the benefits of a mass COVID-19 immunization program, and the safety of a vaccine whilst ensuring or engendering trust in those bodies that brand a campaign may be most supportive of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. © 2021 The Author(s).

The problem arises primarily with regard to some religious groups’ concerns about the connection between certain COVID-19 vaccines and abortion. Vaccines currently approved in Western countries make use of foetal cell lines obtained from aborted foetuses either at the testing stage (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines) or at the development stage (Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine). The Catholic Church’s position is that, if there are alternatives, Catholic people have a moral obligation to request the vaccine whose link with abortion is more remote, which at present means that they should refuse the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. We argue that any consideration regarding free choice of the vaccine should apply to religious and non-religious claims alike, in order to avoid religion-based discrimination. However, we also argue that, in a context of limited availability, considering the significant differences in costs and effectiveness profile of the vaccines available, people should only be allowed to choose the preferred vaccine if: 1) this does not risk compromising vaccination strategies; and 2) they internalize any additional cost that their choice might entail. The State should only subsidize the vaccine that is more cost-effective for any demographic group from the point of view of public health strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Pandemic ethics; Religious freedom; Vaccination ethics","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Freedom of Religion; Humans; Policy; Pregnancy; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; vaccine; female; human; policy; pregnancy; vaccination"

The detrimental effects of the virus can be seen in the nation's health, economy and government operations, leading to radical uncertainty that is exacerbated by the absence of any definitive treatment or vaccines. The level of knowledge about and trust in treatment and vaccination varies worldwide. This study aims to assess the willingness of Palestinians to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and their knowledge about such vaccines. Methods An online survey of adults over 18 years old (n=1080) was conducted in Palestine in October 2020. Using multivariate logistic regression, we identified correlates of participants' willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Results We found that about 63% of participants were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. However, acceptance varied with the specific demographic variables that were investigated. Women, married participants and those aged 18-24 years are more likely to take the vaccine. Further, participants with good knowledge about the vaccine and its side effects are more willing to get the vaccine. Conclusion The availability of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in Palestine is crucial to decrease the burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In addition, to ensure a high vaccination rate, health awareness campaigns should target those who are not willing to get the vaccine, especially those who are more vulnerable and the elderly.  © ","COVID-19; health policy; infection control; infectious diseases; public health","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; adult; Article; attitude to health; coronavirus disease 2019; female; groups by age; health survey; human; knowledge; male; married person; Palestine; Palestinian; vaccine hesitancy; young adult; adolescent; aged; cross-sectional study; vaccination"

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all ages, particularly for newborns and children under the age of 5 (goal 3b), it is essential to generate and use quality data for evidence-based decision making to overcome barriers inherent in immunization systems. In Pakistan, only 66 % of children receive all basic vaccinations, and in Sindh province, the number is even lower at 49 %. In 2012, IRD developed and piloted Zindagi Mehfooz (Safe Life; ZM) ElR, an Android-based platform that records and analyses individual-level child data in real-time. In 2017 in collaboration with Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) Sindh, ZM was scaled-up across the entire Sindh province and is currently being used by 2521 government vaccinators in 1539 basic health facilities, serving >48 million population. Objective: The study aims to demonstrate how big immunization data from the ZM-EIR is being leveraged in Sindh, Pakistan for actionable decision making via three use cases (a) improving performance management of vaccinators to increase geographical coverage, (b) quantifying the impact of provincial accelerated outreach activities, and (c) examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunization coverage to help devise a tailored approach for future efforts. Methods: From October 2017 to April 2020, more than 2.9 million children and 0.9 million women have been enrolled, and more than 22 million immunization events have been recorded in the ZM-EIR. We extracted de-identified data from ZM-EIR for January 1, 2019 – April 20, 2020, period. Given the needs of each use case, monthly and daily indicators on vaccinator performance (attendance and compliance), daily immunization visits, and the number of antigens administered were calculated. Geo-coordinate data of antigen administration was extracted and displayed on geographic maps using QGIS. All generated reports were shared at fixed frequency with various stakeholders, such as partners at EPI-Sindh, for utilization in decision making and informing policy. Result: Our use-cases demonstrate the use of EIR data for data-driven decision making. From January – December 2019, the monthly monitoring of program indicators helped increase the vaccinator attendance from 44% to 88%, while an 85 % increase in geographical coverage was observed in a polio-endemic super high-risk union council (SHRUC) in Karachi. The analysis of daily average antigens administered during accelerated outreach efforts (AOE) as compared to routine activities showed an increase in average daily Pentavalent-3, Measles-1, and Measles-2 vaccines administered by 103%, 154%, and 180% respectively. These findings helped decide to continue the accelerated effort in high-risk areas (compared to the entire province) rather than discontinuing the activity due to high costs. During COVID-19 lockdown, the daily average number of child immunizations reduced from 16,649 to 4335 per day, a decline of 74% compared to 6 months preceding COVID-19 lockdown. ZM-EIR data is currently helping to shape the planning and implementation of critical strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The big data for vaccines generated through EIRs is a powerful tool to monitor immunization work-force and ensure chronically missed communities are identified and covered through targeted strategies.

The objective of our study was to examine how the pandemic affected forgone health care during 3 stages of the pandemic. Methods We used the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Rapid Response Questionnaire administered in summer 2020, fall 2020, and winter 2021 to examine sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases, COVID-19 vaccination status, and telehealth availability in relation to beneficiary reports of forgone health care. Results Of the 3 periods studied, the overall rate of forgone health care was highest in summer 2020 (20.8%), followed by fall 2020 (7.8%) and winter 2021 (6.5%). COVID-19 vaccination status, age, sex, race and ethnicity, US region, availability of primary care telehealth appointments, and chronic conditions (heart disease, arthritis, depression, osteoporosis or a broken hip, and diabetes or high blood glucose) were significantly related to forgone care. Conclusion High rates of forgone care among Medicare participants varied over time and were significantly related to beneficiary characteristics.

With the availability of multiple vaccines across the globe, framing vaccination policies for effectively inoculating a country’s population against such diseases is currently a crucial task for public health agencies. Social network users post their views and opinions on vaccines publicly and these posts can be put to good use in identifying vaccine hesitancy. In this paper, a vaccine hesitancy identification approach is proposed, built on novel text feature modeling based on evolutionary computation and topic modeling. The proposed approach was experimentally validated on two standard tweet datasets – the flu vaccine dataset and UK COVID-19 vaccine tweets. On the first dataset, the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art in terms of standard metrics. The proposed model was also evaluated on the UKCOVID dataset and the results are presented in this paper, as our work is the first to benchmark a vaccine hesitancy model on this dataset. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Evolutionary computation; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Population health analytics; Topic modeling","Information systems; Information use; Optimization; Vaccines; Evolutionary optimizations; Identification approach; Public-health agencies; Standard metrics; State of the art; Text feature; Topic Modeling; World population; Natural language processing systems"

Historical records indicate that vaccine hesitancy existed by the 18th century in Europe and even resulted in violent riots. The drivers of vaccine hesitancy have evolved over the last 200 years but not, perhaps, as much as one might expect. More problematic are the means by which concerns over vaccine hesitancy are communicated by a new landscape of digital communication, generating what has been described as an “infodemic” in which an overabundance of information—both factual and misinformation—contributes to hesitancy. In this review, we discuss the background and current drivers of vaccine hesitancy and the evidence base for strategies to combat this.

Vaccine hesitancy, characterized by lack of confidence in vaccination and/or complacency about vaccination that may lead to delay or refusal of vaccination despite the availability of services, threatens to undermine the success of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination programs. The rapid pace of vaccine development, misinformation in popular and social media, the polarized sociopolitical environment, and the inherent complexities of large-scale vaccination efforts may undermine vaccination confidence and increase complacency about COVID-19 vaccination. Although the experience of recent lethal surges of COVID-19 infections has underscored the value of COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring population uptake of COVID-19 vaccination will require application of multilevel, evidence-based strategies to influence behavior change and address vaccine hesitancy. Recent survey research evaluating public attitudes in the United States toward the COVID-19 vaccine reveals substantial vaccine hesitancy. Building upon efforts at the policy and community level to ensure population access to COVID-19 vaccination, a strong health care system response is critical to address vaccine hesitancy. Drawing on the evidence base in social, behavioral, communication, and implementation science, we review, summarize, and encourage use of interpersonal, individual-level, and organizational interventions within clinical organizations to address this critical gap and improve population adoption of COVID-19 vaccination. © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research","","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media; Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; attitude assessment; community assessment; coronavirus disease 2019; evidence based medicine; health care planning; health program; human; interpersonal communication; misinformation; politics; population research; Review; social behavior; social media; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine production; attitude to health; epidemiology; immunology; pandemic; patient attitude; pharmacology; prevention and control; social media; vaccination"

This study aimed to increase the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in a coordinated manner to ensure equal accessibility to all Taiwanese residents. A total of 3301 health insurance special pharmacies, equivalent to 80% of all community pharmacies in Taiwan, are assisting the public in scheduling vaccines. Once pharmacists had ensured adequate vaccine availability, vaccinations were scheduled depending on the time of registration on the platform for vaccination appointments. The roll-out of this program saw a significant number of people register and receive the vaccine throughout the country, and the number of individuals who received both a first and second dose increased significantly. Community pharmacy-based distribution of the vaccine to the public signifies the novel and innovative involvement of pharmacists in government initiatives to promote public health. Our study shows that community pharmacies can potentially enhance the efficiency and equitable distribution of health supplies and resources, particularly during pandemics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Community pharmacy; COVID-19 pandemic; Pharmacists; Vaccine","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; community pharmacist; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; health care access; health care availability; health care planning; health equity; health insurance; health program; health promotion; hospital management; human; Note; public health service; Taiwan; vaccination"

During the period of COVID-19, people who are in the absence of effective treatment and limited availability of vaccination need a higher health literacy to protective themselves. In order to provide a summary of the health literacy research, a visualized and Scientometric analysis is applied in this study. Methods: Based on a scientific review of 3,670 data on health literacy from Web of Science, this research uses Citespace software to systematically and objectively describe health literacy to determine the knowledge evolution structure between articles and investigate research trends. Results: The results show that the annual outputs of publications have grown rapidly since 2003. The USA and Australia make larger contributions compared with other countries in terms of quantity of publications and worldwide collaboration relationship between them. The “Soc Sci Med,” “J Health Commun.” “Patient Educ Couns” and “J Gen Intern Med” pay more attention to health literacy research. The leading authors with influence and authority are Wolf MS, Osborne RH, and Paasche-Orlow MK. Health literacy research in this field focuses on care, knowledge, and education, and so on. An emerging trend of health literacy with Covid-19, online tools, nursing, and obesity will spread across the globe. Conclusion: Compared with simply reviewing existing articles, the major contribution in this study is a comprehensive review of yearly scientific output, journals, countries, institutions, contributors, highly cited papers, and keywords for health literacy research. The review also provides valuable and seminal guidelines for interested researchers on health literacy research.

In the absence of an effective drug, one effective measure to pull the pandemic to the end is herd immunity by taking vaccines, while the hesitation and anti-attitude from social media affect the vaccination. This makes it crucial to evaluate the text data about the COVID-19 vaccine from tweets. The period for data used in this study is 1 Aug to 31 Oct, 2020, since it is just before promoting the use when public reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine can influence their subsequent vaccination behavior. In this study, we used the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model and sentiment analysis to explore public reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. The results indicate that the public discussion could be divided into 11 topics, which could be further summarized into four different themes: (1) concerns about COVID-19; (2) concerns about vaccine development, production, and distribution; (3) how to control the COVID-19 before obtaining the vaccine; and (4) concerns about information of vaccine safety and efficacy. It can be concluded that to a large extent, public reactions to vaccines are dominated by positive sentiment. Specifically, the politicization of the vaccine approval process, suspension of vaccine trials, and measures to control COVID-19 tend to trigger negative public sentiment; whereas information related to successful vaccine development and availability enhances positive public sentiment. These findings help us understand public reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, uncover potential factors that may influence vaccination behavior, and help policymakers understand public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine and develop rational and effective policies.  © 2022 Jiangyi He and Maojun Zhou.","","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Pandemics; Social Media; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; Article; attitude to health; coronavirus disease 2019; human; infection control; public opinion; sentiment analysis; social media; temporal analysis; trend study; vaccination; vaccine development; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine production; drug therapy; epidemiology; pandemic; prevention and control"

However, the implementation of vaccination varies greatly across countries, with the developing countries lagging behind. This study investigates Indonesia’s vaccination experiences, challenges, and acceleration over the course of implementation period. This study provides simulations to estimate the vaccination rate using time-series forecasting machine learning. We use Administrative data and Survey results in our analysis. Our findings suggest limited vaccine availability had caused low-coverage vaccination implementation in the early stage of vaccination implementation period. However, following the increased availability of vaccine, the vaccination rate accelerates up to 600% times. The government of Indonesia utilized strategic public places, public and private offices, and engaging private sectors in the phase two implementation to accelerate the vaccination implementation. Indonesia might reach 63.1 million individuals vaccinated at the end of March 2022, or 35% of the targeted population with up to April 2021 vaccination rate. To accelerate, government introduced a number of new strategies including door-to-door persuasion through neighborhood association (RT), educating individuals, and providing transportation from their home to the vaccination facility. We expect new strategies could further improve vaccination speed by around 1.4 million to 3.5 million individuals per day. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; vaccination acceleration; vaccines","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Indonesia; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; acceleration; Article; community care; coronavirus disease 2019; drug cost; epidemic; forecasting; government; health care cost; health care facility; health care planning; health care policy; health insurance; human; immunization; Indonesia; Internet; machine learning; neighborhood; patient safety; population size; private sector; seasonal variation; simulation; time series analysis; vaccination; Indonesia; pandemic; vaccination"

We argue that game theory and social network models should be used to guide decisions pertaining to vaccination programmes for the best possible results. In the months following the introduction of vaccines, their availability and the human resources needed to run the vaccination programmes have been scarce in many countries. Vaccine hesitancy is also being encountered from some sections of the general public. We emphasize that decision-making under uncertainty and imperfect information, and with only conditionally optimal outcomes, is a unique forte of established game-theoretic modelling. Therefore, we can use this approach to obtain the best framework for modelling and simulating vaccination prioritization and uptake that will be readily available to inform important policy decisions for the optimal control of the COVID-19 pandemic.  © 2021 The Authors.","cooperation; evolutionary game theory; social dilemma; vaccination",""

This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice. Methods: An online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group. Results: Healthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Almost all States included the 65–74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by many States. Conclusions: The prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable despite clear Federal guidance. Future guidance must be relevant to local needs, values, and constraints, to minimize any unwarranted heterogeneity in vaccine access across populations. © 2021 by the authors.

From China, the disease started spreading to the rest of the world. After China, Italy became the next epicentre of the virus and witnessed a very high death toll. Soon nations like the USA became severely hit by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The World Health Organisation, on 11th March 2020, declared COVID-19 a pandemic. To combat the epidemic, the nations from every corner of the world has instituted various policies like physical distancing, isolation of infected population and researching on the potential vaccine of SARS-CoV-2. To identify the impact of various policies implemented by the affected countries on the pandemic spread, a myriad of AI-based models have been presented to analyse and predict the epidemiological trends of COVID-19. In this work, the authors present a detailed study of different artificial intelligence frameworks applied for predictive analysis of COVID-19 patient record. The forecasting models acquire information from records to detect the pandemic spreading and thus enabling an opportunity to take immediate actions to reduce the spread of the virus. This paper addresses the research issues and corresponding solutions associated with the prediction and detection of infectious diseases like COVID-19. It further focuses on the study of vaccinations to cope with the pandemic. Finally, the research challenges in terms of data availability, reliability, the accuracy of the existing prediction models and other open issues are discussed to outline the future course of this study. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Objectives: To assess the status and change in electricity access, sources, and reliability at primary health centers (PHCs) in India; and to understand the effect of regular electricity supply on health services provision and on workforce availability and retention. Materials and Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the lastest two rounds of district-level household survey (DLHS) in India, conducted in 2007-2008 and 2012-2013. Results: Data of 8619 PHCs from DLHS-3 and 8540 PHCs from DLHS-4 were analyzed. The proportion of PHCs with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%. However, regular electricity supply was available at only 50% of PHCs in 2012-2013, which was an increase from 36% such PHCs in 2007-2008. PHCs with regular electricity supply provided services to 50% more beneficiaries (deliveries and vaccination) than PHCs without regular or no electricity (P ≤ 0.001). Increased access to regular electricity was associated with improved availability and retention of health staff (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Government policies should aim to ensure access to regular electricity-supply-beyond just connection from grid-at all GPHCFs, including health sub-centers, PHCs, and community health centers. Indicators on electricity access at GPHCFs could be standardized and integrated into regular health and facility-related surveys as well as in the existing dashboards for real-time data collection. Health policy interventions should be informed by regular data collection and analysis. Improving access to regular electricity supply at GPHCFs can contribute to achieve the goals of National Health Policy of India. This will also help to advance universal health coverage in the country. There are lessons from this study, for other low and middle income countries, on improving health service provision at government health care facilities. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The number of cases and deaths rose exponentially, alongside a sharp increase in hospitalizations and intubated patients. The Thai Government then implemented a lockdown to mitigate the outbreak magnitude and prevent cases from overwhelming the healthcare system. This study aimed to model the severity of the outbreak over the following months by different levels of lockdown effectiveness. Secondary analysis was performed on data primarily obtained from the Ministry of Health; the data were analyzed using both the deterministic compartmental model and the system dynamics model. The model was calibrated against the number of daily cases in Greater Bangkok during June–July 2021. We then assessed the outcomes (daily cases, daily deaths, and intubated patients) according to hypothetical lockdowns of varying effectiveness and duration. The findings revealed that lockdown measures could reduce and delay the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths. A two-month lockdown with 60% effectiveness in the reduction in reproduction number caused the lowest number of cases, deaths, and intubated patients, with a peak about one-fifth of the size of a no-lockdown peak. The two-month lockdown policy also delayed the peak until after December, while in the context of a one-month lockdown, cases peaked during the end of September to early December (depending on the varying degrees of lockdown effectiveness in the reduction in reproduction number). In other words, the implementation of a lockdown policy did not mean the end of the outbreak, but it helped delay the peak. In this sense, implementing a lockdown helped to buy time for the healthcare system to recover and better prepare for any future outbreaks. We recommend further studies that explore the impact of lockdown measures at a sub-provincial level, and examine the impact of lockdowns on parameters not directly related to the spread of disease, such as quality of life and economic implications for individuals and society. © 2021 by the authors.

COVID-19 pandemic has even been declared a national health emergency in Indonesia. Various efforts have been made to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic, one of which is vaccination. The COVID-19 vaccination aims to establish herd immunity. Herd immunity requires about 70% of the population to be vaccinated. However, the vaccination raises pros and cons in the community. There are even groups of people who refuse to be vaccinated. This community group feels that mandatory vaccination violates human rights and doubts about the quality of the vaccine. The Government has taken a policy to mandate vaccination with administrative and criminal sanctions that are different from the approach of WHO and other countries. This research is a normative study with a conceptual and a normative approach analysis. Data uses secondary data from the literature, both legal and non-legal materials related to covid vaccination. The results show that vaccination is a very important policy in COVID-19 countermeasures. Mandatory vaccination must be carried out to protect all citizens according to the Indonesian constitution. Vaccination is also part of human rights that must be accommodated and implemented. However, in its implementation, there are problems with doubts and rejection of the vaccine. This obligation causes the restriction of several human rights. However, refusal to vaccinate can violate human rights because it can harm other people and the nation. Therefore, the provision of both administrative and criminal sanctions should be the ultimum remedium. A persuasive and promotive approach and socialization should be the initial approach. However, the regulation of vaccination obligations has shortcomings ranging from the potential for errors in law-making procedures to the absence of an umbrella act. Umbrella act specifically for COVID-19 is a must-have due to an abnormal situation. And the obligation to vaccinate citizens also has implications for the state to be obliged to carry out vaccinations. The Government is obliged to run a vaccination program by ensuring the availability, access, acceptance, and quality of COVID-19 vaccinations. © 2021","Covid-19; Health Emergency; Mandatory Vaccination",""

To support the monitoring of these processes and associated decision-making, a dashboard was designed in Google Data Studio focused on analyzing the progress of COVID-19 vaccination and its logistics efficiency. This article describes the design and implementation of the dashboard using a design science approach and discusses the main lessons learned. During its development, four major challenges were identified: the search for and availability of data sources, the definition and standardization of metrics, the extraction of data in different formats; and finally, the validation of the metrics. Despite these challenges, the dashboard became a source of information for different stakeholders in the Colombian COVID-19 vaccination network, facilitating the monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs), supporting decision-making, and policy evaluation. This reaffirms the importance of having open information to generate knowledge for both public and private entities as well as for the public. The main contribution of this work is the definition and standardization of the KPIs and it is therefore expected that this experience will serve as an insightful input for designing mass vaccination strategies.

As has been demonstrated, however, vaccine uptake is often uneven and incomplete across populations. This is a substantial challenge that must be addressed by public health efforts. To this point, significant research has focused on demographic and attitudinal correlates with vaccine hesitancy to understand uptake patterns. In this study, however, we advance understandings of individual decision-making processes involved in vaccine uptake through a mixed-methods investigation of the role of timing in COVID-19 vaccine choices. In the first step, a survey experiment, we find the timing of vaccine rollout (i.e., when a vaccine becomes available to the respondent) has a significant impact on public decision-making. Not only is there a higher level of acceptance when the vaccine becomes available at a later time, but delayed availability is correlated with both lower levels of ‘desire to wait’ and ‘total rejection’ of the vaccine. In a second step, we explore associated qualitative data, finding that temporal expressions (i.e., professing a desire to wait) can serve as a proxy for underlying non-temporal rationales, like concerns around safety, efficacy, personal situations, or altruism. By identifying these patterns, as well as the complexities of underlying factors, through a mixed-methods investigation, we can inform better vaccine-related policy and public messaging, as well as enhance our understanding of how individuals make decisions about vaccines in the context of COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors.

Study design: A descriptive study. Methods: The data concerning the organization of the vaccination campaign were taken from the operative protocol developed by the hospital dedicated task force, composed by experts in hygiene, public health, occupational medicine, pharmacists, nurses, hospital quality, and disaster managers. Data about the numbers of vaccine administered daily were collected by the Innovation and Development Operative Unit database. Results: Vaccinations against COVID-19 started across the EU on the 27th of December 2020. The first phase of the vaccination campaign carried out in our hospital was directed to healthcare workers immunization including medical residents, social care operators, administrative staff and technicians, students of medicine, and health professions trainees. The second phase was enlarged to the coverage of extremely fragile subjects. Thanks to the massive employment of healthcare workers and the establishment of dynamic pathways, it was possible to achieve short turnaround times and a large number of doses administered daily, with peaks of 870 vaccines per day. From the 27th of December up to the 14th of March a total of 26,341 doses of Pfizer have been administered. 13,584 were first doses and 12,757 were second doses. From the 4th to the 14th of March, 296 first doses of Moderna were dispensed. It was necessary to implement adequate spaces and areas adopting anti-contagion safety measures: waiting area for subjects to be vaccinated, working rooms for the dilution of the vaccine and the storage of the material, vaccination rooms, post-vaccination observation areas, room for observation, and treatment of any adverse reactions, with an emergency cart available in each working area. Conclusions: The teaching hospital of Pisa faced the beginning of the immunization campaign readjusting its spaces, planning an adequate hospital vaccination area and providing an organization plan to ensure the achievement of the targets of the campaign.

While we were able to identify the causative agent within a few days of the disease outbreak, several questions still remain unanswered. In this review, we discuss the extent of virus spread, current statistics, SARS-CoV-2 genome organization, comparison between the novel coronavirus and causative agents involved in previous outbreaks, ongoing clinical trials and myths associated with the virus. Lastly, we provide insights into the future perspectives which could prove useful for the scientific community as they work on finding the cure against the disease. Impact statement: Early availability of the sequence, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), has prompted efforts towards identifying a safe and effective vaccine in the current public health emergency. To that end, understanding the pathophysiology of disease is crucial for scientists around the world. Since conventional vaccine development and manufacturing may take several years, it is important to think about alternative strategies that we could use to mitigate imminent catastrophe. We hope that this article will open up new avenues and provide insights that could potentially save hundreds of lives affected by COVID-19. © 2020 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","2019-nCoV; China; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; Wuhan","Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Genome, Viral; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Serine Proteinase Inhibitors; adenosine phosphate; alanine; antivirus agent; remdesivir; serine proteinase inhibitor; anorexia; Article; artificial intelligence; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease surveillance; fatigue; gene structure; health care policy; heart arrhythmia; human; immune response; lymphocytopenia; machine learning; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; virus detection; virus replication; virus shedding; Betacoronavirus; China; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; genetics; pandemic; procedures; SARS coronavirus; virus genome; virus pneumonia"

The question is relevant because, initially, vaccine availability will likely be limited. After healthcare and some other essential workers, it might seem the most obvious candidates are the elderly and other groups that are more vulnerable to the virus. However, we argue that this is not necessarily the case. Protecting the most vulnerable might require prioritizing vaccinating children in order to maximize the benefits of indirect immunity for the elderly and the other vulnerable groups. Whether this will be the best strategy from a public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of the virus, which are currently unknown. Here, we assess this possibility from an ethical point of view, by drawing comparisons and analogies with the case of the flu vaccination and with other examples of health policies and practices. We conclude that there are strong ethical reasons to vaccinate the young to protect the old, provided that the risks imposed on children are reasonable, even if that implies using children as a means to protect the elderly and the vulnerable.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources. However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging. Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake. © 2020","Coronavirus; Influenza season; Influenza vaccination; Limited resources; Pandemic outbreak","Coinfection; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemics; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Mass Vaccination; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Health care; Health risks; Public health; influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; Detection capability; Health interventions; Health-care system; Infectious agents; Influenza vaccines; Life-threatening infections; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Public authorities; COVID-19; detection method; epidemiology; influenza; public health; respiratory disease; vaccination; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; epidemic; evidence based medicine; flu like syndrome; health care availability; health care facility; health care utilization; hospital admission; infectious agent; influenza; influenza vaccination; mass immunization; mathematical model; medical decision making; pandemic; public health service; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus transmission; communicable disease control; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; influenza; mixed infection; pandemic; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Vaccines"

However, when a similar virus spread globally triggering the COVID-19 pandemic, we were harshly reminded that several other neglected diseases might also be waiting for the perfect opportunity to become mainstream. As climate change drives urbanization, natural selection of pathogens and their intermediate vectors and reservoirs, the risk of neglected diseases emerging within a larger susceptible pool becomes an even greater threat. Availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely considered the only way to end this pandemic. Similarly, vaccines are also seen as the best tools available to control the spread of neglected (sometimes referred to as emerging or re-emerging) diseases, until the water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure is improved in areas of their prevalence. Vaccine production is usually cost and labour intensive and thus minimal funding is directed towards controlling and eliminating neglected diseases (NDs). A customised but sustainable approach is needed to develop and deploy vaccines against NDs. While safety, efficacy and public trust are the three main success pillars for most vaccines, affordability is vital when formulating vaccines for neglected diseases. © 2020","AMR; Global Health; Infectious Diseases; LMICs; Neglected diseases; Public Health; Vaccination; Vaccine; Vaccine Policy","Communicable Diseases, Emerging; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Global Health; Humans; Neglected Diseases; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccinology; cholera vaccine; rabies vaccine; Rotavirus vaccine; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; typhoid vaccine; vaccine; antibiotic resistance; cholera; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease re-emergence; feces; global health; human; infection; mouth disease; neglected disease; public health; rabies; Review; Rotavirus infection; typhoid fever; vaccination; vector borne disease; zoonosis; communicable disease; immunology; neglected disease; prevention and control; procedures"

COVID-19 badly affects countries that did not have universal immunization policies or having them only for the selective population of countries (highly prominent population) like Italy, USA, UK, Netherland, etc. Universal immunization of BCG can provide great protection against the COVID-19 infection because the BCG vaccine gives broad protection against respiratory infections. BCG vaccine induces expressions of the gene that are involved in the antiviral innate immune response against viral infections with long-term maintenance of BCG vaccine-induced cellular immunity. COVID-19 cases are reported very much less in the countries with universal BCG vaccination policies such as India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Israel, Japan, etc. as compared to without BCG implemented countries such as the USA, Italy, Spain, Canada, UK, etc. BCG vaccine provides protection for 50–60 years of immunization, so the elderly population needs to be revaccinated with BCG.

It stands to reason that the spread of the virus depends on sociocultural ecologies that facilitate or inhibit social contact. In particular, the community-level tendency to engage with strangers and freely choose friends, called relational mobility, creates increased opportunities to interact with a larger and more variable range of other people. It may therefore be associated with a faster spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Here, we tested this possibility by analyzing growth curves of confirmed cases of and deaths due to COVID-19 in the first 30 days of the outbreaks in 39 countries. We found that growth was significantly accelerated as a function of a country-wise measure of relational mobility. This relationship was robust either with or without a set of control variables, including demographic variables, reporting bias, testing availability, and cultural dimensions of individualism, tightness, and government efficiency. Policy implications are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; open data; open materials; relational mobility; sociocultural factors","BCG Vaccine; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Humans; Internationality; Models, Biological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Social Behavior; Vaccination; BCG vaccine; Betacoronavirus; biological model; Coronavirus infection; cultural factor; human; international cooperation; legislation and jurisprudence; pandemic; public health; social behavior; vaccination; virus pneumonia"
