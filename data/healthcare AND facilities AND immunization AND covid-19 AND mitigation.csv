Recent evidence suggests that this will cause additional maternal and childhood mortality and morbidity especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here we have explored the contextual factors influencing maternal, neonatal and children health (MNCH) care in Bangladesh, Nigeria and South Africa amidst the pandemic. Our findings suggest that between March and May 2020, there was a reduction in utilisation of basic essential MNCH services such as antenatal care, family planning and immunization due to: a) the implementation of lockdown which triggered fear of contracting the COVID-19 and deterred people from accessing basic MNCH care, and b) a shift of focus towards pandemic, causing the detriment to other health services, and c) resource constraints. Taken together these issues have resulted in compromised provision of basic general healthcare. Given the likelihood of recurrent waves of the pandemic globally, COVID-19 mitigation plans therefore should be integrated with standard care provision to enhance system resilience to cope with all health needs. This commentary suggests a four-point contextualised mitigation plan to safeguard MNCH care during the pandemic using the observed countries as exemplars for LMIC health system adaptations to maintain the trajectory of progress regarding sustainable development goals (SDGs). © 2021, The Author(s).","Basic healthcare; COVID-19; LMICs; MNCH","Adult; Bangladesh; Child; Child Health Services; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Developing Countries; Facilities and Services Utilization; Female; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Nigeria; Pregnancy; Public Health; Quarantine; South Africa; Vulnerable Populations; Bangladesh; Nigeria; South Africa; child health; COVID-19; family planning; integrated approach; maternal effect; maternal health; morbidity; mortality; policy implementation; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; Article; Bangladesh; child health care; coronavirus disease 2019; family planning; female; health care access; health care need; health care system; health care utilization; human; immunization; lockdown; low income country; maternal health service; middle income country; newborn; Nigeria; pandemic; prenatal care; priority journal; South Africa; sustainable development; adult; child; communicable disease control; developing country; legislation and jurisprudence; pregnancy; prevention and control; procedures; public health; quarantine; vulnerable population"

This disruption has threatened the control of major high-burden diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria as well as the prevention of maternal and child mortality. • While the 2020 WHO global reports for HIV, TB, and malaria show progress in control of these diseases in African countries, there are still significant gaps in meeting the global targets. Similarly, modeling studies predict that most African countries are unlikely to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 targets for reductions in maternal and child mortality under the current rate of progress. • Prediction models and emerging empirical data indicate that the implemented mitigation measures against COVID-19 such as travel restrictions and lockdowns as well as the repurposing of health resources and suspension of prevention programs such as immunizations will lead to an increase in new infections and deaths, significantly reversing the gains achieved in the control of these health challenges. • A more comprehensive COVID-19 response that minimizes indirect deaths is therefore warranted in Africa. These include implementing WHO recommendations that limit contact with the clinic where possible, such as multimonths drug dispensing, self-testing, virtual platforms for case management, community- and home-based prevention, and care services such as home distribution of test kits, vaccines, treatment, and mosquito nets. • This is in addition to ensuring effective implementation of COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures in healthcare facilities including providing healthcare workers with personal protective equipment and prioritizing them for COVID-19 immunization. • There is also a need to incorporate aggressive recovery plans to reverse the lost gains in disease control efforts and put African countries back on course toward achieving the global targets. This includes leveraging on the wider COVID-19 response enablements such as the increased political will and global solidarity funding efforts to support a more comprehensive response that accounts for the indirect public health effects of the pandemic. © 2021 Inzaule et al.

When available, vaccination at-scale has helped drive a rapid reduction in severe cases. However, vaccination coverage remains incomplete among residents and staff, such that additional mitigation and prevention strategies are needed to reduce the ongoing risk of transmission. One such strategy is that of “shield immunity”, in which immune individuals modulate their contact rates and shield uninfected individuals from potentially risky interactions. Methods: Here, we adapt shield immunity principles to a network context, by using computational models to evaluate how restructured interactions between staff and residents affect SARS-CoV-2 epidemic dynamics. Results: First, we identify a mitigation rewiring strategy that reassigns immune healthcare workers to infected residents, significantly reducing outbreak sizes given weekly testing and rewiring (48% reduction in the outbreak size). Second, we identify a preventative prewiring strategy in which susceptible healthcare workers are assigned to immunized residents. This preventative strategy reduces the risk and size of an outbreak via the inadvertent introduction of an infectious healthcare worker in a partially immunized population (44% reduction in the epidemic size). These mitigation levels derived from network-based interventions are similar to those derived from isolating infectious healthcare workers. Conclusions: This modeling-based assessment of shield immunity provides further support for leveraging infection and immune status in network-based interventions to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19. © 2022 The Author(s)","Bipartite network; Cohorting; Compartmental epidemiological model; COVID-19; Long-term care facility; Mitigation strategy; Reproductive number; SARS-CoV-2; Variant; Viral testing","COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Humans; Long-Term Care; SARS-CoV-2; Skilled Nursing Facilities; adult; Article; computer model; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; health care personnel; human; immunization; major clinical study; nursing home; resident; staff; virus immunity; virus transmission; vulnerable population; long term care; nursing home; prevention and control"

The pathogenic characteristics of a virus are influenced by mutations in the viral genome. Therefore, the recently identified Omicron BF.7 subvariant might harm humans. Here we aimed to evaluate the potential risks of this newly detected variant and identify possible mitigation strategies. The frequent mutation associated with SARS-CoV-2 makes it more concerning compared to other viruses. The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has unique changes in the structural amino acid. Thus, Omicron subvariants are different from other coronavirus variants in terms of viral spread, disease severity, vaccine neutralization capacity, and immunity evade. Moreover, Omicron subvariant BF.7 is an offspring of BA.4 and BA.5. Similar S glycoprotein sequences are present among BF.7, BA.4, and BA.5. There is a change in the R346T gene in the receptor binding site of Omicron BF.7 than other Omicron subvariants. This BF.7 subvariant has created a limitation in current monoclonal antibody therapy. Omicron has mutated since it emerged, and the subvariants are improving in terms of transmission as well as antibody evasion. Therefore, the healthcare authorities should pay attention to the BF.7 subvariant of Omicron. The recent upsurge may create havoc all of a sudden. Scientists and researchers across the world should monitor the nature and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Also, they should find ways to fight the current circulatory variants and any future mutations. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods The number of weekly consultations for antenatal care (ANC), outpatient (OPD), immunisations (EPI), family planning (FP) and HIV services, between January 2018 and December 2020, were collected from 25 facilities in Masaka district, Uganda, 21 in Goma, and 29 in Kambia district, Sierra Leone. Negative binomial regression models accounting for clustering and season were used to analyse changes in activity levels between 2018, 2019 and 2020. Results In Goma, we found no change in OPD, EPI or ANC consultations, FP was 17% lower in March-July 2020 compared to 2019, but this recovered by December 2020. New diagnoses of HIV were 34% lower throughout 2020 compared to 2019. In Sierra Leone, compared to the same periods in 2019, facilities had 18-29% fewer OPD consultations throughout 2020, and 27% fewer DTP3 doses in March-July 2020. There was no evidence of differences in other services. In Uganda there were 20-35% fewer under-5 OPD consultations, 21-66% fewer MCV1 doses, and 48-51% fewer new diagnoses of HIV throughout 2020, compared to 2019. There was no difference in the number of HPV doses delivered. Conclusions The level of disruption varied across the different settings and qualitatively appeared to correlate with the strength of lockdown measures and reported attitudes towards the risk posed by COVID-19. Mitigation strategies such as health communications campaigns and outreach services may be important to limit the impact of lockdowns on primary healthcare services. © 2023 Kasonia et al.
