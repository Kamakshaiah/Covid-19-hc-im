A real-world population-based longitudinal study was designed with the aim to define the magnitude and duration of immunity induced by each of four different COVID-19 vaccines available in Italy at the time of this study. Overall, 2497 individuals were enrolled at time of their first vaccination (T0). Vaccine-specific antibody responses induced over time by Comirnaty, Spikevax, Vaxzevria, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S and heterologous vaccination were compared up to six months after immunization. On a subset of Comirnaty vaccinees, serology data were correlated with the ability to neutralize a reference SARS-CoV-2 B strain, as well as Delta AY.4 and Omicron BA.1. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and memory B cells induced by the four different vaccines was assessed six months after the immunization. We found that mRNA vaccines are stronger inducer of anti-Spike IgG and B-memory cell responses. Humoral immune responses are lower in frail elderly subjects. Neutralization of the Delta AY.4 and Omicron BA.1 variants is severely impaired, especially in older individuals. Most vaccinees display a vaccine-specific T-cell memory six months after the vaccination. By describing the immunological response during the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination campaign in different cohorts and considering several aspects of the immunological response, this study allowed to collect key information that could facilitate the implementation of effective prevention and control measures against SARS-CoV-2.

A total of 520 respondents were selected by a simple random sampling method. The questionnaire was designed in multiple languages and categorized as; demographic details, perceptions, motivation factors, and barriers to acceptance of a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine among the respondents. Both anonymous, self-administered, closed-ended online, and paper-based questionnaire was used to assess the above parameters. A higher proportion of the respondents were females (55.2%) with an age range of 36.7±7.7 years. About 36.2% of respondents had a poor perception of the booster dose. Significant differences in the levels of perceptions were found among different age groups and also among the respondents with or without chronic medical conditions. Nearly 49.8% of respondents had hesitation about the booster dose, 58.8% of respondents recommended others to get the booster vaccine at the earliest and 49.8% preferred to develop natural immunity to infection. The hesitation for the booster was more among the female respondents and the older age groups (≥ 60 years) though a large number (43.2%) believe that the booster vaccination is going to end the pandemic worldwide. Further nationwide studies involving different subpopulations are recommended. Public health education is the need of the hour to reduce such barriers and hesitancy. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

Depending on the extent of genomic variations, mutations and adaptation, few of the variants gain the ability to spread quickly across many countries, acquire higher virulency and ability to cause severe disease, morbidity and mortality. These variants have been implicated in lessening the efficacy of the current COVID-19 vaccines and immunotherapies resulting in break-through viral infections in vaccinated individuals and recovered patients. Altogether, these could hinder the protective herd immunity to be achieved through the ongoing progressive COVID-19 vaccination. Currently, the only variant of interest of SARS-CoV-2 is Omicron that was first identified in South Africa. In this review, we present the overview on the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with a special focus on the Omicron variant, its lineages and hybrid variants. We discuss the hypotheses of the origin, genetic change and underlying molecular mechanism behind higher transmissibility and immune escape of Omicron variant. Major concerns related to Omicron including the efficacy of the current available immunotherapeutics and vaccines, transmissibility, disease severity, and mortality are discussed. In the last part, challenges and strategies to counter Omicron variant, its lineages and hybrid variants amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are presented. © 2022 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Emerging variance; Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; Variant of concern","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; coronavac; elasomeran; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; vaxzevria; adaptation; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic procedure; disease severity; environmental factor; evolutionary adaptation; gene insertion; genomic mutation; health care system; human; immunological memory; indel mutation; mass immunization; nonhuman; Review; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; susceptible population; epidemiology; genetics; pandemic"

We analyzed the determinants of quantitative serology at 9 months after vaccination in a multicenter cohort. Methods: We analyzed data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody levels at 9 months from the first dose of vaccinated HCW from eight centers in Italy, Germany, Spain, Romania and Slovakia. Serological levels were log-transformed to account for the skewness of the distribution and normalized by dividing them by center-specific standard errors. We fitted center-specific multivariate regression models to estimate the cohort-specific relative risks (RR) of an increase of one standard deviation of log antibody level and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and combined them in random-effects meta-analyses. Finally, we conducted a trend analysis of 1 to 7 months’ serology within one cohort. Results: We included 20,216 HCW with up to two vaccine doses and showed that high antibody levels were associated with female sex (p = 0.01), age (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.86–0.88 per 10-year increase), 10-day increase in time since last vaccine (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.97–0.98), previous infection (3.03, 95% CI = 2.92–3.13), two vaccine doses (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.09–1.36), use of Spikevax (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.39–1.64), Vaxzevria (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.44–0.73) or heterologous vaccination (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.12–1.57), compared to Comirnaty. The trend in the Bologna cohort, based on 3979 measurements, showed a decrease in mean standardized antibody level from 8.17 to 7.06 (1–7 months, p for trend 0.005). Conclusions: Our findings corroborate current knowledge on the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity and declining trend with time. © 2022 by the authors.","antibody level; COVID-19; immunization; serology; temporal trends; vaccine","Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; European People; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Immunity; Vaccination; antibody; elasomeran; s antibody; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; tozinameran; unclassified drug; vaxzevria; virus antibody; adult; antibody blood level; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; covid 19 vaccination; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; Germany; health care personnel; human; immune response; Italy; male; multicenter study; quantitative analysis; risk factor; Romania; Slovakia; Spain; vaccination; clinical trial; health care personnel; immunity; prevention and control; vaccination"

To elicit a robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infections, antigens produced by mRNAs encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein need to be efficiently delivered and presented to antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs). As concurrent innate immune stimulation can facilitate the antigen presentation process, a library of non-nucleotide STING agonist-derived amino lipids (SALs) was synthesized and formulated into LNPs for mRNA delivery. SAL12 lipid nanoparticles (SAL12-LNPs) were identified as most potent in delivering mRNAs encoding the Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 while activating the STING pathway in DCs. Two doses of SAL12 S-LNPs by intramuscular immunization elicited potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. © 2023 American Chemical Society","lipid nanoparticles; mRNA; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein; STING; vaccine","Animals; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Mice; RNA, Messenger; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Antigens; Diseases; Encoding (symbols); Glycoproteins; Mammals; Nanoparticles; RNA; Signal encoding; Vaccines; messenger RNA; STING1 protein, human; Antigen presenting cells; Dendritics; Encodings; Immune response; Large-scales; Lipid nanoparticles; Messenger RNA; Protective immunities; Spike protein; STING; animal; human; mouse; vaccination; Coronavirus"

Recent Findings: There is a greater than expected occurrence of severe neurological adverse events such as cortical sinus venous thrombosis, Bell’s palsy, transverse myelitis, and Guillain–Barré syndromes along with other common effects such as headaches following different kinds of COVID-19 vaccination. Precipitation of new onset demyelinating brain lesions with or without detection of specific antibodies and worsening of pre-existing neurological disorders (like epilepsy, multiple sclerosis) are also a matter of great concern though no conclusive evidence implicating the vaccines is available as of now. Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic is far from being over. Till such time that a truly effective anti-viral drug is discovered, or an appropriate therapeutic strategy is developed, COVID-appropriate behavior and highly effective mass vaccination remain the only weapons in our armamentarium to fight this deadly disease. As often occurs with most therapeutic means for the treatment and prevention of any disease, vaccination against COVID-19 has its hazards. These range from the most trivial ones like fever, local pain and myalgias to several potentially serious cardiac and neurological complications. The latter group includes conditions like cerebral venous thrombosis (curiously often with thrombocytopenia), transverse myelitis and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy amongst others. Fortunately, the number of reported patients with any of these serious complications is far too low for the total number of people vaccinated. Hence, the current evidence suggests that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risk of these events in majority of the patients. As of now, available evidence also does not recommend withholding vaccination in patients with pre-existing neurological disorders like epilepsy and MS, though adenoviral vaccines should be avoided in those with history of thrombotic events. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cortical sinus venous thrombosis; COVID-19 vaccination; Guillain–Barré syndrome; Multiple sclerosis (MS); Neurological complications; Transverse myelitis (TM)","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Myelitis, Transverse; Pandemics; Vaccination; Venous Thrombosis; D dimer; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; abducens nerve paralysis; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; adult; arterial ischemic stroke; arterial ischemic stroke; behavior; Bell palsy; brain damage; brain disease; brain hemorrhage; cerebral sinus thrombosis; cerebrovascular accident; cranial nerve paralysis; deep vein thrombosis; ear disease; encephalitis; encephalomyelitis; epilepsy; eye disease; faintness; female; fever; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; herpes zoster; human; immunization; incidence; mass immunization; middle aged; multiple sclerosis; myalgia; myositis; neuroleptic malignant syndrome; neurologic disease; neurological complication; optic neuritis; parsonage turner  syndrome; parsonage turner syndrome; public health; review; Review; rhabdomyolysis; risk factor; seizure; smelling disorder; subarachnoid hemorrhage; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; transverse myelitis; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; adverse event; complication; Guillain Barre syndrome; myelitis; pandemic; prevention and control; vaccination; vein thrombosis"

However, there are very few studies that analyse individual vaccination decisions using a qualitative methodology. To close this gap, we conducted a qualitative interview study to examine the opinions and experiences with the vaccine among patients previously hospitalized due to COVID-19, including barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake. An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured telephone interviews, was conducted among 22 patients admitted for COVID-19 in Poland in 2022. Opinions of patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 on vaccination were varied. Barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake stemmed from concerns about vaccine safety, patients’ religious beliefs, and negative stories. High disease severity and anxiety over personal and family health were important arguments in favour of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The study findings indicated the need for ongoing health education by healthcare staff as well as coordination and integration of multi-sectoral institutional measures regarding COVID-19 prevention strategies as well as increased public health initiatives on social media and engagement of community leaders for awareness about vaccines and vaccination. It is crucial to build trust in COVID-19 vaccinations among the general public by disseminating reliable information through trustworthy and credible sources. However, it ought to be emphasised that, regardless of the measures taken, some individuals will remain unconvinced about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; Polish patients; qualitative research; vaccination barriers; vaccine uptake","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; adult; aged; anxiety; Article; artificial ventilation; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; decision making; disease severity; e-mail; family health; female; health behavior; health care facility; health education; hospitalization; human; immunization; innate immunity; Internet; interview; male; pandemic; Poland; Polish citizen; public health; qualitative research; reliability; religion; social media; social network; structured interview; thematic analysis; travel restriction; vaccination; vocational education; workplace"

Although the entire impact of COVID-19 pandemic on existing global public health is yet to be fully seen, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on global childhood immunization programs is of particular importance. Recent Findings: Disruptions to service delivery due to lockdowns, challenges in vaccination programs, vaccine misinformation and hesitancy, and political and social economic inequalities all posed a threat to existing childhood immunization programs. These potential threats were especially critical in LMIC where childhood immunization programs tend to experience suboptimal implementation. Summary: This review provides an overview of childhood immunizations and discusses past pandemics particularly in LMIC, factors contributing to disparities in childhood immunizations, and reviews potential lessons to be learned from past pandemics. Vaccine hesitancy, social determinants of health, and best practices to help lessen the pandemic’s influence are also further elaborated. To address current challenges that hindered the progress made in prevention of childhood illnesses through vaccination campaigns and increased vaccine availability, lessons learned through best practices explored from past pandemics must be examined to mitigate impact of COVID-19 on childhood immunization and in turn conserve health and improve economic well-being of children especially in LMIC. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Childhood immunizations; COVID-19; Pandemics; Vaccine hesitancy","BCG vaccine; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; Haemophilus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; measles vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; Rotavirus vaccine; rubella vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; childhood; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; health care delivery; herd immunity; human; immunization; middle income country; misinformation; mortality; pandemic; practice guideline; Review; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; vaccination; vaccination refusal; vaccine hesitancy"

However, it can also lead to undesirable outcomes if mass vaccination results in increased transmission of effective contacts and relaxation of other public health interventions due to the perceived immunity from the vaccine. Methods: We designed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that takes into consideration the epidemiological status, public health intervention status (quarantined/isolated), immunity status of the population, and strain variations. Comparing the control reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes (attack rate) in the cases with and without vaccination, we quantified some key factors determining when vaccination in the population is beneficial for preventing and controlling future outbreaks. Results: Our analyses predicted that there is a critical (minimal) vaccine efficacy rate (or a critical quarantine rate) below which the control reproduction number with vaccination is higher than that without vaccination, and the final attack rate in the population is also higher with the vaccination. We also predicted the worst case scenario occurs when a high vaccine coverage rate is achieved for a vaccine with a lower efficacy rate and when the vaccines increase the transmission efficient contacts. Conclusions: The analyses show that an immunization program with a vaccine efficacy rate below the predicted critical values will not be as effective as simply investing in the contact tracing/quarantine/isolation implementation. We reached similar conclusions by considering the final epidemic size (or attack rates). This research then highlights the importance of monitoring the impact on transmissibility and vaccine efficacy of emerging strains. © 2022, The Author(s).","Compartment model; COVID-19; Final Size, Attack Rate, Strain variations; Reproduction numbers; Vaccination","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Pandemics; Probability; Vaccination; Vaccination Coverage; epidemiology; human; pandemic; prevention and control; probability; vaccination; vaccination coverage"

With the anticipated reduction of clinical testing as the disease moves into an endemic state, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance (WWS) will have greater value as an important diagnostic tool. An in-depth analysis and understanding of the metrics derived from WWS is required to interpret and utilize WWS-acquired data effectively (McClary-Gutierrez et al., 2021; O'Keeffe, 2021). In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater signal to clinical cases (WC) ratio was investigated across seven cities in Canada over periods ranging from 8 to 21 months. This work demonstrates that significant increases in the WC ratio occurred when clinical testing eligibility was modified to appointment-only testing, identifying a period of insufficient clinical testing (resulting in a reduction to testing access and a reduction in the number of daily tests) in these communities, despite increases in the wastewater signal. Furthermore, the WC ratio decreased significantly in 6 of the 7 studied locations, serving as a potential signal of the emergence of the Alpha variant of concern (VOC) in a relatively non-immunized community (40–60 % allelic proportion), while a more muted decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Delta VOC in a relatively well-immunized community (40–60 % allelic proportion). Finally, a significant decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Omicron VOC, likely because of the variant's greater effectiveness at evading immunity, leading to a significant number of new reported clinical cases, even when community immunity was high. The WC ratio, used as an additional monitoring metric, could complement clinical case counts and wastewater signals as individual metrics in its potential ability to identify important epidemiological occurrences, adding value to WWS as a diagnostic technology during the COVID-19 pandemic and likely for future pandemics. © 2022 The Authors","COVID-19; Public-health; SARS-CoV-2; Variant; Wastewater surveillance; Wastewater-based epidemiology","COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Waste Water; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring; Diagnosis; Immunization; Public health; virus RNA; % reductions; Clinical testing; Control effort; Health monitoring; Infection control; Monitoring control; Urban community; Variant; Wastewater surveillance; Wastewater-based epidemiology; COVID-19; epidemiology; health monitoring; immunity; pandemic; public health; wastewater; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; herd immunity; human; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TCID50; urban population; vaccination; variant of concern; virus load; wastewater; wastewater-based epidemiology; epidemiology; pandemic; wastewater; Coronavirus; COVID-19"

This study aimed to evaluate the immunity levels against pertussis among populations of different ages in China. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional serological survey in Zhejiang Province, China in 2020. Serum IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin (anti-PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (anti-FHA), and pertactin (anti-PRN) were quantitatively measured. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of three antibodies was calculated. An anti-PT level < 5 IU/mL was considered undetectable, ≥20 IU/mL as seropositive and ≥80 IU/mL as an indicator of recent infection. Mathematical models were fitted for anti-PT concentrations over time in children after four doses of the pertussis vaccination. Results: A total of 4459 participants aged 0–59 years were included in the analyses. The overall positivity rate of anti-PT was 29.80% with the highest (81.44%) rate in the 1–2 years old and the lowest (4.72%) in 10–14 years old. The GMCs of anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN for the whole participants were 9.67 (95%CI: 9.25–10.10),18.93 (18.24–19.67), and 8.99 (8.61–9.38) IU/mL, respectively. Over 50% of subjects aged ≥ 7 years had undetectable anti-PT IgG antibodies (<5IU/mL). The proportions of the populations with anti-PT IgG ≥ 80 IU/mL were approximately 0.9%, 0.3% and 1.1% among the 10–14, 15–29, and 40–59 years old groups, respectively. The power regression equation of the attenuation model after last dose of pertussis vaccine was y = 41.088x-1.238 (R2 = 0.935, p < 0.001). The fitted anti-PT concentrations was only 5.60 IU/mL at 5 years following the last vaccination dose. Conclusion: The prevalence of pertussis decreased during the study period in the COVID-19 pandemic; however, there was still a certain proportion of adolescents and adults with evidence of recent infection. The decline in antibody levels after pertussis vaccination was observed, and booster doses are in urgent need in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Antibody; Pertussis; Seroprevalence; Vaccine","Adolescent; Adult; Antibodies, Bacterial; Child; Child, Preschool; China; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Infant; Pandemics; Pertussis Toxin; Pertussis Vaccine; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Whooping Cough; hemagglutinin; immunoglobulin G antibody; pertactin; pertussis toxin; pertussis vaccine; bacterium antibody; immunoglobulin G; adolescent; adult; Article; child; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; deterioration; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; human experiment; immunity; immunization; infant; male; pandemic; pertussis; positivity rate; prevalence; public health; seroepidemiology; seroprevalence; vaccination; China; pandemic; pertussis; preschool child; seroepidemiology"

However, vaccination policies remain lax in some places, such as the Madura region, making efforts to create herd immunity slow and challenging. This study used a qualitative descriptive method to collect data using interviews, the COVID-19 task force website, and reliable online sources. Data and information were triangulated to improve researchers' comprehension. Then proceed to data reduction, display, and verification to get detailed results and conclusions. According to this study's findings, the immunization policy's efficiency in the Madura region is still low until early September 2021. Several factors contribute to this, including low citizen participation, a lack of socialization intensity and direct involvement of religious and community leaders, public perception of COVID-19, and numerous post-vaccination symptoms that are not addressed immediately by the government and health workers. As a result, developing herd immunity in Madura is challenging if achieved through vaccination.

Inspired by the unprecedent success of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines, the development of a safe and effective mRNA vaccine against MPXV is of high priority. Based on our established lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA vaccine platform, we rationally constructed and prepared a panel of multicomponent MPXV vaccine candidates encoding different combinations of viral antigens including M1R, E8L, A29L, A35R, and B6R. In vitro and in vivo characterization demonstrated that two immunizations of all mRNA vaccine candidates elicit a robust antibody response as well as antigen-specific Th1-biased cellular response in mice. Importantly, the penta- and tetra-component vaccine candidates AR-MPXV5 and AR-MPXV4a showed superior capability of inducing neutralizing antibodies as well as of protecting from VACV challenge in mice. Our study provides critical insights to understand the protection mechanism of MPXV infection and direct evidence supporting further clinical development of these multicomponent mRNA vaccine candidates. © 2023 The Author(s).

The consistently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring critical mutations impact the molecular characteristics of viral proteins and display heterogeneous behaviors in immune evasion, transmissibility, and the clinical manifestation during infection, which differ each strain and endow them with distinguished features during populational spread. Several SARS-CoV-2 variants, identified as Variants of Concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization, challenged global efforts on COVID-19 control due to the rapid worldwide spread and enhanced immune evasion from current antibodies and vaccines. Moreover, the recent Omicron variant even exacerbated the global anxiety in the continuous pandemic. Its significant evasion from current medical treatment and disease control even highlights the necessity of combinatory investigation of the mutational pattern and influence of the mutations on viral dynamics against populational immunity, which would greatly facilitate drug and vaccine development and benefit the global public health policymaking. Hence in this review, we summarized the molecular characteristics, immune evasion, and impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and focused on the parallel comparison of different variants in mutational profile, transmissibility and tropism alteration, treatment effectiveness, and clinical manifestations, in order to provide a comprehensive landscape for SARS-CoV-2 variant research. © 2022, The Author(s).","","COVID-19; Humans; Immune Evasion; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; alanine aminotransferase; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; aspartate aminotransferase; bamlanivimab; bebtelovimab; casirivimab; chloroquine; cilgavimab; cilgavimab plus tixagevimab; coronavac; covilo; elasomeran; etesevimab; hemagglutinin; imdevimab; immunoglobulin G; influenza vaccine; interferon; lopinavir plus ritonavir; molnupiravir; neutralizing antibody; regdanvimab; RNA directed RNA polymerase; structural protein; tixagevimab; tozinameran; vaxzevria; viral protease; viral protein; virus spike protein; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; antiviral activity; anxiety; arthralgia; artificial ventilation; asthma; avian influenza (H5N1); binding affinity; breathing rate; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotoxicity; depression; disease severity; dizziness; drug targeting; dyspnea; EC50; fatigue; fever; genetic susceptibility; headache; health care policy; herd immunity; hospitalization; human; humoral immunity; IC50; immune evasion; immune response; immunization; immunogenicity; influenza; insomnia; lymphocytopenia; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mouse; mutational analysis; nonhuman; oxygen saturation; pandemic; phagocytosis; post exposure prophylaxis; protein structure; public health; quality of life; Review; rhinorrhea; risk factor; SARS coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2 variant 20-C; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; systematic review; thorax pain; thrombocytopenia; vaccination; vaccine development; variant of concern; virus genome; virus infection; virus infectivity; virus isolation; virus neutralization; virus replication; virus shedding; virus transmission; X ray diffraction; genetics; immune evasion"

We aim to test the hypothesis that immunity achieved post COVID-19 infection combined with vaccination (hybrid immunity), is more effective against Omicron infection than vaccination alone in a health-care setting. Methods: Data on regular pre-emptive PCR testing from all Health-Care Workers (HCWs) at Laiko University Hospital from 29th December 2020, date on which the national COVID-19 immunization program began in Greece, until 24th May 2022, were retrospectively collected and recorded. The infection rate was calculated after December 21st, 2021, when Omicron was the predominant circulating variant in Greece, as the total number of infections (positive PCR COVID-19 test regardless of symptoms) divided by the total person-months at risk. Results: Of 1,305 vaccinated HCWs who were included in the analysis [median age of 47 (IQR: 36, 56) years, 66.7 % women], 13 % and 87 % had received 2 or 3 vaccine doses (full and booster vaccination), respectively. A COVID-19 infection had occurred in 135 of 1,305 of participants prior to Omicron predominance. Of those 135 HCWs with hybrid immunity only 13 (9.6 %) were re-infected. Of the 154 and 1,016 HCWs with full and booster vaccination-induced immunity, respectively, 71 (46.1 %, infection rate 13.4/100 person-months) and 448 (44.1 %, infection rate 12.2/100 person-months) were infected during the follow up period. No association between gender or age and COVID-19 infection was found and none of the participants had a severe infection or died. Conclusions: Hybrid immunity confers higher protection by almost 5-fold compared to full or booster vaccination for COVID-19 infection with the Omicron variant among HCWs who are at high risk of exposure. This may inform public health policies on how to achieve optimal immunity in terms of the timing and mode of vaccination. © 2022","COVID-19; Health-Care Workers (HCWs); Hybrid immunity; Infection rate; Vaccine","COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; ad26.cov2.s vaccine; elasomeran; tozinameran; adult; age distribution; Article; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; female; follow up; Greece; health care personnel; health care system; high risk population; human; hybrid immunity; infection rate; major clinical study; male; middle aged; polymerase chain reaction; public health service; reinfection; retrospective study; risk factor; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; sex ratio; university hospital; vaccine immunogenicity; virus immunity; virus strain; virus virulence; prevention and control; vaccination"

This study aims to identify sociodemographic predictors of vaccine hesitancy, main reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and how these reasons are explained by sociodemographic characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study (N = 5 442) was carried out in June 2021. A web-based survey was conducted among six eastern districts in Oslo with high infection pressure. Sociodemographic variables included gender, age, country of birth, education, and household income. Binary logistic regression models were used to explore predictors of both vaccine hesitancy and specific reasons for hesitancy. Results: Vaccine hesitancy was low overall (5.8%). Findings indicate that participants with younger ages, lower education, and lower household income, and those born outside of Norway were prone to vaccine hesitancy. Over half of the vaccine hesitant sample cited barriers relating to confidence in the vaccines. Women and participants born in Norway were more likely hesitant due to fear of side effects and there being little experience with the vaccines. Otherwise, complacency barriers such as not feeling that they belonged to a risk group (46.1%), not needing the vaccines (39.1%), and wanting the body to develop natural immunity (29.3%) were frequently selected by participants. Conclusion: Different determinants of vaccine hesitancy among population groups demonstrate the need for clear public health communication about the risks, benefits, and importance of vaccines. Future studies with a larger sample should verify current findings and further explore the role of convenience barriers in health literacy and language. Health authorities should take these results into account and develop different public health strategies targeted at vulnerable population groups during the current and future pandemics to increase vaccine uptake and reach sufficient immunization. © 2022, The Author(s).","Barriers to vaccine uptake; COVID-19; Reasons for vaccine hesitancy; Sociodemographic predictors of vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine intention","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Vaccination; Vaccination Hesitancy; Vaccines; vaccine; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; female; human; pandemic; patient attitude; prevention and control; vaccination"

Although several vaccines have received emergency approval through various public health agencies, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues. Emergent variants of concern, waning immunity in the vaccinated, evidence that vaccines may not prevent transmission and inequity in vaccine distribution have driven continued development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to address these public health needs. In this report, we evaluated a novel self-amplifying replicon RNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a pigtail macaque model of COVID-19 disease. We found that this vaccine elicited strong binding and neutralizing antibody responses against homologous virus. We also observed broad binding antibody against heterologous contemporary and ancestral strains, but neutralizing antibody responses were primarily targeted to the vaccine-homologous strain. While binding antibody responses were sustained, neutralizing antibody waned to undetectable levels in some animals after six months but were rapidly recalled and conferred protection from disease when the animals were challenged 7 months after vaccination as evident by reduced viral replication and pathology in the lower respiratory tract, reduced viral shedding in the nasal cavity and lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate in pigtail macaques that a self-amplifying replicon RNA vaccine can elicit durable and protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, these data provide evidence that this vaccine can provide durable protective efficacy and reduce viral shedding even after neutralizing antibody responses have waned to undetectable levels.

This study examined the joint effect of vaccine coverage and NPIs on the control of local and sporadic resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Between July 2021 and January 2022, we collected the large-scale testing information and case number of imported COVID-19 patients from the website of the National Health Commission of China. A compartment model was developed to identify the level of vaccine coverage that would allow safe relaxation of NPIs, and vaccination strategies that can best achieve this level of coverage. We applied Monte Carlo simulation 50 000 times to remove random fluctuation effects and obtain fitted/predicted epidemic curve based on various parameters with 95% confidence interval at each time point. Results: We found that a vaccination coverage of 50.4% was needed for the safe relaxation of NPIs, if the vaccine effectiveness was 79.3%. The total number of incidence cases under the key groups firstly strategy was 103 times higher than that of accelerated vaccination strategy. It needed 35 months to fully relax NPIs if the key groups firstly strategy was implemented, and 27 months were needed with the accelerated vaccination strategy. If combined the two strategies, only 8 months are needed to achieve the vaccine coverage threshold for the fully relaxation of NPIs. Sensitivity analyses results shown that the higher the transmission rate of the virus and the lower annual vaccine supply, the more difficult the epidemic could be under control. When the transmission rate increased 25% or the vaccination effectiveness rate decreased 20%, 33 months were needed to reduce the number of total incidence cases below 1000. Conclusions: As vaccine coverage improves, the NPIs can be gradually relaxed. Until that threshold is reached, however, strict NPIs are still needed to control the epidemic. The more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant led to higher resurgence probability, which indicates the importance of accelerated vaccination and achieving the vaccine coverage earlier.

Understanding the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination apprehension among parents in different societies is crucial for effectively implementing COVID-19 vaccination programs. This observational cross-sectional study was carried out in the Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia between February and April 2022. The validated questionnaire was shared with parents who had children between the ages of five and eleven years. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Multinomial regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors significantly affecting vaccine-use decisions. Of the 699 participants, 83% of the mothers were between the ages of 35 and 44 years, 67% were university educated, and only 14% were healthcare workers. A large proportion of parents, with an age range of 18–34 years (p = 0.001), and those with a higher income group (p = 0.014), demonstrated significant vaccine hesitancy. Further, parents who received one or two vaccination doses were significantly (p = 0.02) more hesitant than those who received more than two doses of the vaccine. Furthermore, a significantly (p = 0.002) high percentage of parents who follow the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines for personal preventive measures were hesitant about their children’s vaccination. Concerns about side effects (31.4%) and a lack of safety data (31.2%) on the COVID-19 vaccines were the two most significant reasons for parents to develop vaccine hesitancy. Social media (24.3%), poor perceived immunity (16.3 %), and news articles (15.5%) were the top three contributors to this hesitancy. Vaccinated parents were 8.21 times more likely to be vaccination-hesitant than non-vaccinated parents. Additionally, parents with less education and a COVID-19-positive child at home increased the odds of vaccine hesitancy by 1.66 and 1.48 times, respectively. Overall, one-third of the parents were not prepared to vaccinate their children, and one-quarter of the respondents had not decided about vaccination. This study shows that parents in Riyadh are generally reluctant to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. As social media is a primary source of information for parents, public health professionals should utilize the platform to encourage parents to support vaccine acceptance. © 2023 by the authors.","children; COVID-19 vaccine; healthcare; public health; vaccine hesitancy","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; awareness; caregiver; child; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; drug safety; education; female; health care personnel; human; immunity; immunization; income group; information source; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; mother; practice guideline; public health; questionnaire; self concept; structured questionnaire; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; wellbeing"

Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether individuals with COVID-19 could have benefited from vaccination against influenza. We hypothesized that the immunity resulting from the previous influenza vaccination would boost part of the immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We performed a population-based cohort study including all patients with COVID-19 with registered entries in the primary health care (PHC) electronic records during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1 to June 30, 2020) in Catalonia, Spain. We compared individuals who took an influenza vaccine before being infected with COVID-19, with those who had not taken one. Data were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care, capturing PHC information of 5.8 million people from Catalonia. The main outcomes assessed during follow-up were a diagnosis of pneumonia, hospital admission, and mortality. Results: We included 309,039 individuals with COVID-19 and compared them on the basis of their influenza immunization status, with 114,181 (36.9%) having been vaccinated at least once and 194,858 (63.1%) having never been vaccinated. In total, 21,721 (19%) vaccinated individuals and 11,000 (5.7%) unvaccinated individuals had at least one of their outcomes assessed. Those vaccinated against influenza at any time (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.19), recently (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.10-1.18), or recurrently (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) before being infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of presenting at least one of the outcomes than did unvaccinated individuals. When we excluded people living in long-term care facilities, the results were similar. Conclusions: We could not establish a protective role of the immunity conferred by the influenza vaccine on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection, as the risk of COVID-19 complications was higher in vaccinated than in unvaccinated individuals. Our results correspond to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more complications and mortalities due to COVID-19 had occurred. Despite that, our study adds more evidence for the analysis of a possible link between the quality of immunity and COVID-19 outcomes, particularly in the PHC setting. © Maria Giner-Soriano, Vanessa de Dios, Dan Ouchi, Carles Vilaplana-Carnerero, Mònica Monteagudo, Rosa Morros.","cohort study; COVID-19; eHeatlh; electronic health records; epidemiology; health outcome; influenza vaccines; mortality; pneumonia; primary health care; public health; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination","Cohort Studies; COVID-19; Electronics; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; SARS-CoV-2; influenza vaccine; cohort analysis; electronics; human; influenza; pandemic; prevention and control; primary health care"

In fact, the idea of injecting a mild form of “disease” into a healthy person was attacked even earlier than the discovery of vaccines. The forerunner of Jenner's vaccination with bovine lymph was the inoculation of smallpox material from person to person, which, known in Europe since the beginning of the eighteenth century, was a target of harsh criticism. The reasons for criticizing the Jennerian vaccination and its mandatory practice were medical, anthropological, biological (vaccination is not safe), religious and ethical (it is wrong to inoculate a healthy person with disease), and political (vaccination is a threat to individual freedom). As such, anti-vaccination groups emerged in England, where inoculation was adopted early, as well as overall in Europe and in the United States. This paper focuses on the lesser known debate that arose in Germany in the years 1852–53 about the medical practice of vaccination. This is an a important topic of public health that has aroused a wide debate and comparison especially in recent years and now with pandemic on Sars-Cov-2 (Covid-19) and will probably be the subject of further reflection and consideration in the coming years. © 2023","Germany; History of vaccination; Inoculation; Smallpox; Vaccine-hesitancy; XIX century","Animals; Cattle; COVID-19; Germany; History, 18th Century; Humans; Immunization; SARS-CoV-2; Smallpox; Smallpox Vaccine; United States; Vaccines; smallpox vaccine; vaccine; Article; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; Europe; evidence based practice; Germany; health care personnel; herd immunity; history; human; immune system; immunization; immunogenicity; medical information; medical practice; nonhuman; pandemic; physician; prevalence; prophylaxis; public health; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smallpox; vaccine hesitancy; vulnerable population; World Health Organization; animal; bovine; history; immunization; smallpox; United States"

The first was that vaccines should be targeted to older and vulnerable people, with the aim of maximally preventing disease rather than infection. The second was to increase the interval between first and second doses from 3 to 12 weeks. Here, we re-examine these recommendations through a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England. We show that targeting the most vulnerable had the biggest immediate impact (compared to targeting younger individuals who may be more responsible for transmission). The 12-week delay was also highly beneficial, estimated to have averted between 32-72 thousand hospital admissions and 4-9 thousand deaths over the first ten months of the campaign (December 2020–September 2021) depending on the assumed interaction between dose interval and efficacy. © 2023, The Author(s).","","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; England; Epidemics; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; England; United Kingdom; bnt 162b 2; tozinameran; vaxzevria; epidemic; health impact; infectious disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; death toll; disease burden; drug efficacy; England; epidemic; herd immunity; hospital admission; human; mathematical model; pandemic; public health; vaccination; England; epidemic; epidemiology; prevention and control; vaccination"

Multiple segments of society, including healthcare workers, have expressed concerns regarding the need for vaccination and the safety of current vaccines. Many hospital-based nurses have helped care for patients with severe COVID-19 infections. An anonymous online survey was sent to the nursing staff at University Medical Center in Lubbock, TX, USA, through a hospital-based email system to determine vaccination status and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine and other routine vaccines. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with vaccination. A total of 251 nurses responded to this survey; 211 nurses (83.7%) had received the vaccine. Almost all nurses (242, 96%) had received all childhood vaccinations, and 231 (91.7%) had received an influenza vaccination in the prior year. A minority of nurses (75, 29.8%) supported mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers. The reasons for declining vaccination included the possibility that diet and alternative medications provided better protection against COVID-19. This survey demonstrates that over 80% of nurses working in a hospital managing very sick patients with COVID-19 infection had been vaccinated. However, nurses who did not take the annual influenza vaccine and did not consider other protective measures useful (such as mask-wearing) were significantly less likely to vaccinate. Nurses can provide an important resource for conversations with the public and patients about vaccine initiatives. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; nurses; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy","influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; behavior; conversation; coronavirus disease 2019; e-mail; female; health care facility; health care personnel; human; immunization; influenza vaccination; innate immunity; job stress; major clinical study; male; nurse; nursing staff; pharmacist; physician; questionnaire; social media; Texas; university hospital; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy"

That rubella epidemic led to the development of a rubella vaccine that has been introduced in all but 21 countries worldwide and has led to elimination of rubella in 93 countries. Although widespread introduction and use of rubella vaccines was slower than that for COVID-19 vaccines, the process can provide valuable insights for the continued battle against COVID-19. Experiences from the rubella disease control program highlight the critical and evolving elements of a vaccination program, including clearly delineated goals and strategies, regular data-driven revisions to the program based on disease and vaccine safety surveillance, and evaluations to identify the vaccine most capable of achieving disease control targets. © 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

This study aims to demonstrate how coupling wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) with meta-data can identify which factors contribute toward the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 within a local community. Throughout the pandemic, the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were tracked by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and analyzed in the context of the number of positive swab cases, the extent of human movement, and intervention measures. Our findings suggest that during the early phase of the pandemic, when strict lockdown was imposed, the viral titer load in the wastewater remained below detection limits, with <4 positive swab cases reported over a 14-day period in the compound. After the lockdown was lifted and global travel gradually resumed, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected in the wastewater on 12 August 2020 and increased in frequency thereafter, despite high vaccination rates and mandatory face-covering requirements in the community. Accompanied by a combination of the Omicron surge and significant global travel by community members, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in most of the weekly wastewater samples collected in late December 2021 and January 2022. With the cease of mandatory face covering, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in at least two of the four weekly wastewater samples collected from May through August 2022. Retrospective Nanopore sequencing revealed the presence of the Omicron variant in the wastewater with a multitude of amino acid mutations, from which we could infer the likely geographical origins through bioinformatic analysis. This study demonstrated that long-term tracking of the temporal dynamics and sequencing of variants in wastewater would aid in identifying which factors contribute the most to SARS-CoV-2 dissemination within the local community, facilitating an appropriate public health response to control future outbreaks as we now live with endemic SARS-CoV-2. © 2023 The Authors","Enclosed community; Nucleocapsid genes; Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing; SARS-CoV-2; University; Wastewater-based epidemiology","Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Retrospective Studies; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Wastewater; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring; Diseases; Nanopores; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; complementary DNA; coronavirus nucleocapsid protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; virus RNA; Enclosed community; Local community; Nucleocapsid gene; Nucleocapsids; Oxford nanopore technology sequencing; RNA concentration; Temporal dynamics; University; Wastewater samples; Wastewater-based epidemiology; COVID-19; disease prevalence; disease spread; disease transmission; epidemic; epidemiology; identification method; mutation; pandemic; public health; wastewater; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; antigenic escape; Article; bacteriophage; cellular immunity; child; community transmission; contact examination; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; false negative result; gene amplification; gene dosage; genetic distance; human; limit of detection; lockdown; mass immunization; municipal wastewater; N1 gene; N2 gene; nanopore sequencing; nonhuman; nonsynonymous substitution; pandemic; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; quarantine; retrospective study; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; Saudi Arabia; sensitivity and specificity; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; social distancing; virus detection; virus load; virus particle; virus shedding; waste water treatment plant; wastewater-based epidemiology; winter; communicable disease control; coronavirus disease 2019; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; wastewater; wastewater-based epidemiology; Coronavirus"

While many vaccines have shown excellent efficacy in protecting the general public from the COVID-19 infection, the efficacy of these vaccines for people living with HIV (PLHIV), especially those having a different range of CD4 + T-cell, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Few studies have uncovered the escalated infection and death rates due to the COVID-19 infection in individuals with low CD4 + T-cells. Additionally, PLHIV has a low CD4 + count; furthermore, specific CD4 + T cells for coronavirus have a vigorous Th1 role and are related to the protective antibody responses. Follicular helper T cells (TFH) are vulnerable to HIV and virus-specific CD4 & CD8 T-cells which are essential for viral infection clearance and defective immune responses which further contributes to the development of illness. The specific CD8 & CD4 + T-cell reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in almost all COVID-19 recovered individuals, which is related to the size of antibodies of immunoglobulin G. It has previously been demonstrated that PLHIV has decreased responses to certain vaccines and that these responses are reliant on CD4 + T-cell levels. COVID-19 vaccines will likely have a lower response or limited effect, in PLHIV having low CD4 + T-cells. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-retroviral therapy; Cytokine; HIV infection; Immunosuppression; Inflammation; PLHIV; Vaccine","adenovirus vector; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; CD69 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR5; chemokine receptor CXCR4; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; dolutegravir; gamma interferon; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; ibacovavec; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin G; influenza vaccine; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; interleukin 22; interleukin 7; lamivudine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tenofovir; transmembrane protease serine 2; tumor necrosis factor; vaxzevria; virus spike protein; antibody response; antibody titer; antiretroviral therapy; Article; artificial ventilation; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hospitalization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunization; inflammation; lung fibrosis; morbidity; mortality; neurologic disease; pathogen clearance; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; vaccination; virus infection; virus replication"

Social media presents unique opportunities to reach broader audiences and reduces the costs of conducting national or global campaigns aimed at achieving herd immunity. Nonetheless, few studies have reviewed the effectiveness of prior social media campaigns for vaccination adherence, and several prior studies have shown that social media campaigns do not increase uptake rates. Hence, our objective is to conduct a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of social media campaigns and to identify the reasons for the mixed results of prior studies. Our methodology began with a search of seven databases, which resulted in the identification of 92 interventions conducted over digital media. Out of these 92 studies, only 15 adopted social media campaigns for immunization. We analyzed these 15 studies, along with a coding scheme we developed based on reviews of both health interventions and social media campaigns. Multiple coders, who were knowledgeable about social media campaigns and healthcare, analyzed the 15 cases and obtained an acceptable level of inter-coder reliability (>.80). The results from our systematic review show that only a few social media campaigns have succeeded in enhancing vaccination adherence. In addition, few campaigns have utilized known critical success factors of social media to induce vaccination adherence. Based on these findings, we discuss a set of research questions that informatics scholars should consider when identifying opportunities for using social media to resolve one of the most resilient challenges in public health. Finally, we conclude by discussing how the insights drawn from our systematic reviews contribute to advancing theories, such as social influence and the health belief model, into the realm of social media–based health interventions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital health; Interventions; Social media campaigns; Systematic review; Vaccines","COVID-19; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Digital health; Health interventions; Herd immunities; Intervention; Large-scales; Media campaigns; Social media; Social medium campaign; Systematic Review; Uptake rate; Vaccines"

The study aimed to evaluate the level of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and their persistence in recovered, naïve, and vaccinated individuals. We investigated anti-spike RBD IgG antibody responses in 10,000 individuals, both following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and immunization with SARS-COV-2 AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, Sinopharm, and Sinovac. The mean levels of anti-spike IgG antibodies were higher in vaccinated participants with prior COVID-19 than in individuals without prior COVID-19. Overall, antibody titers in recovered vaccinee and naïve vaccinee persisted beyond 20 weeks. Vaccination with adenoviral–vector vaccines (AstraZeneca and Sputnik V) generates higher antibody titers than with killed virus vaccine (Sinopharm and Sinovac). Approximately two-thirds of asymptomatic unvaccinated individuals had developed virus-specific antibodies. A single dose of vaccine is likely to provide greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with apparent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, than in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals. In addition, the high number of seropositivity among asymptomatic unvaccinated individuals showed that the number of infections are probably highly underestimated. Those vaccinated with inactivated vaccine may require more frequent boosters than those vaccinated with adenoviral vaccine. These findings are important for formulating public health vaccination strategies during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 by the authors.","antibody titers; COVID-19 vaccines; humoral immunity; SARS-CoV-2; spike protein","coronavac; covilo; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; sputnik v vaccine; vaxzevria; adult; aged; antibody detection; antibody response; antibody titer; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; humoral immunity; major clinical study; male; middle aged; positivity rate; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination"

Here, we measured different plasm antibody levels 2 and 12 months after disease onset, including anti-RBD, anti-N, total neutralizing antibodies, and two neutralizing-antibody clusters. We found that total neutralizing antibodies declined more slowly than total anti-RBD and anti-N IgG, and the two neutralizing-antibody clusters decayed even more slowly than total neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, the level of neutralizing antibodies at 12 months after disease onset was significantly lower than that at 2 months but more broadly neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Lambda (C.37). Significant immune escape by the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was also observed 2 months post-recovery. Furthermore, we revealed that a high percentage of virus-specific CD4+ T cells and cTfh1 were associated with a slower decline in humoral immunity, accompanied by higher levels of CXCR3 ligands such as CXCL9 and CXCL10, higher frequency of cTfh1, and lower levels of cTfh2 and cTfh17.

Prior to global mass immunization campaigns and during the spread of the wildtype COVID-19 and the Alpha variant of concern (VOC), viral measurement of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater was a leading indicator for both COVID-19 incidence and disease burden in communities. As the two-dose vaccination rates escalated during the spread of the Delta VOC in Jul. 2021 through Dec. 2021, relations weakened between wastewater signal and community COVID-19 disease incidence and maintained a strong relationship with clinical metrics indicative of disease burden (new hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths). Further, with the onset of the vaccine-resistant Omicron BA.1 VOC in Dec. 2021 through Mar. 2022, wastewater again became a strong indicator of both disease incidence and burden during a period of limited natural immunization (no recent infection), vaccine escape, and waned vaccine effectiveness. Lastly, with the populations regaining enhanced natural and vaccination immunization shortly prior to the onset of the Omicron BA.2 VOC in mid-Mar 2022, wastewater is shown to be a strong indicator for both disease incidence and burden. Hospitalization-to-wastewater ratio is further shown to be a good indicator of VOC virulence when widespread clinical testing is limited. In the future, WWS is expected to show moderate indication of incidence and strong indication of disease burden in the community during future potential seasonal vaccination campaigns. © 2022","Deaths; Hospital admissions; Laboratory positive cases; Vaccination; WWS","COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Viral Vaccines; Waste Water; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring; COVID-19; Hospitals; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; virus vaccine; Complementary tools; Death; Disease burdens; Disease incidence; Dynamic relation; Hospital admissions; Laboratory positive case; Vaccination; Wastewater surveillance; Wild types; COVID-19; disease incidence; disease spread; epidemic; hospital sector; immunization; mortality; vaccination; virulence; wastewater; anti-vaccination movement; Article; Canada; coronavirus disease 2019; death; disease burden; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; hydrodynamics; intensive care unit; metric system; morbidity; nonhuman; pandemic; public health; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; seasonal variation; treatment indication; vaccination; virus immunity; virus virulence; wastewater; wastewater-based epidemiology; epidemiology; pandemic; wastewater; Immunization"

There is an urgent need for efficient and safe vaccines against the monkeypox virus (MPXV) in response to the rapidly spreading monkeypox epidemic. In the age of COVID-19, mRNA vaccines have been highly successful and emerged as platforms enabling rapid development and large-scale preparation. Here, we develop two MPXV quadrivalent mRNA vaccines, named mRNA-A-LNP and mRNA-B-LNP, based on two intracellular mature virus specific proteins (A29L and M1R) and two extracellular enveloped virus specific proteins (A35R and B6R). By administering mRNA-A-LNP and mRNA-B-LNP intramuscularly twice, mice induce MPXV specific IgG antibodies and potent vaccinia virus (VACV) specific neutralizing antibodies. Further, it elicits efficient MPXV specific Th-1 biased cellular immunity, as well as durable effector memory T and germinal center B cell responses in mice. In addition, two doses of mRNA-A-LNP and mRNA-B-LNP are protective against the VACV challenge in mice. And, the passive transfer of sera from mRNA-A-LNP and mRNA-B-LNP-immunized mice protects nude mice against the VACV challenge. Overall, our results demonstrate that mRNA-A-LNP and mRNA-B-LNP appear to be safe and effective vaccine candidates against monkeypox epidemics, as well as against outbreaks caused by other orthopoxviruses, including the smallpox virus. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Animals; COVID-19; Immunity; Mice; Mice, Nude; Monkeypox; Monkeypox virus; Vaccines, Combined; Vaccinia virus; Viral Proteins; immunoglobulin A; influenza vaccine; lentivirus vector; messenger RNA; neutralizing antibody; RNA vaccine; tumor necrosis factor; virus vaccine; vaccine; viral protein; adaptive immunity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody titer; Article; bioluminescence; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; encapsulation; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; fluorescence microscopy; genetic transfection; germinal center; histopathology; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; immunogenicity; immunotherapy; innate immunity; macrophage; mature virus; memory cell; monkeypox; Monkeypox virus; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; Orthopoxvirus; photon correlation spectroscopy; public health; smallpox; Smallpox virus; T lymphocyte; transmission electron microscopy; tumor immunity; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; Vaccinia virus; virus neutralization; Western blotting; animal; coronavirus disease 2019; genetics; immunity; monkeypox; Monkeypox virus; Vaccinia virus"

However, challenges persist in many areas within the European Union (EU), resulting in declining coverage rates in many countries in the period between 2010 and 2021. This general trend requires increased efforts to combat barriers around vaccination uptake. Thus, this article aims to summarise key learnings and trends in paediatric vaccination within the EU, with a focus on current challenges and enablers. Methods: Methodology is based on analysis of primary data, mainly vaccination coverage rates, as well as review and analysis of the select relevant literature, including peer-reviewed articles, academic research papers, official reports, policies, and other publicly available sources. Results: For all vaccines assessed (DTP 1st dose, DTP 3rd dose, Hib3, HepB3, measles 1st dose, measles 2nd dose, and polio 3rd dose), a high degree of variation and fluctuation in coverage can be observed. There is a general trend of declining coverage in 2019 compared to 2010, with lower performing countries, such as Romania and Austria, showing increasingly severe coverage fluctuations between the years examined across the analysed vaccines. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that increasing both accessibility and information regarding vaccines are key enablers to vaccination uptake. Moreover, given the current challenges the EU is facing, crisis preparedness plans are pertinent to ensure immunity gaps do not further exacerbate the disruption of vaccination systems. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; misinformation; Ukraine crisis; vaccination coverage; vaccine accessibility; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine uptake","diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; influenza vaccine; measles vaccine; poliomyelitis vaccine; child; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; Europe; geographic distribution; human; immunization; learning; pediatrics; public health; Review; systematic review; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy"

Here we longitudinally analyze SARS-CoV-2 sequences in a B cell-depleted, lymphoma patient with chronic, ultimately fatal infection, and identify three mutations in the spike protein that dampen convalescent plasma-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, four mutations emerge in non-spike regions encoding three CD8 T cell epitopes, including one nucleoprotein epitope affected by two mutations. Recognition of each mutant peptide by CD8 T cells from convalescent donors is reduced compared to its ancestral peptide, with additive effects resulting from double mutations. Querying public SARS-CoV-2 sequences shows that these mutations have independently emerged as homoplasies in circulating lineages. Our data thus suggest that potential impacts of CD8 T cells on SARS-CoV-2 mutations, at least in those with humoral immunodeficiency, warrant further investigation to inform on vaccine design. © 2022, The Author(s).","","CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; COVID-19; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Lymphoma; Mutation; Nucleoproteins; Peptides; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vaccines; beta cyclodextrin; CD8 antigen; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; gamma interferon; HLA B 35:01 antigen; HLA B antigen; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; neutralizing antibody; obinutuzumab; prednisolone; remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma; steroid; unclassified drug; vincristine; virus nucleoprotein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; nucleoprotein; peptide; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; vaccine; additive; antibody; cell; mutation; protein; severe acute respiratory syndrome; vaccine; adaptive immunity; additive effect; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; antigen recognition; antigen specificity; antigenic escape; antiviral therapy; Article; B cell lymphoma; B lymphocyte; cancer combination chemotherapy; case report; CD8+ T lymphocyte; chronic infection; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 serological testing; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; follicular lymphoma; gene mutation; genetic variability; HLA typing; homoplasy; human; human cell; humoral immune deficiency; humoral immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; immunosuppressive treatment; intensive care unit; longitudinal study; lymphocyte subpopulation; medical history; medical record review; multiple drug dose; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; phylogeny; receptor binding; retrospective study; severe renal impairment; spring; Vero C1008 cell line; virus neutralization; virus neutralization test; virus replication; CD8+ T lymphocyte; genetics; lymphoma; mutation; passive immunization; therapy"

In 2020, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cameroon recorded a high cholera case fatality rate of 5.3% following epidemics noted in the South, Littoral, and South-West regions which is far higher than the 1% World Health Organization acceptable rate. Methodology/principal findings: The Ministry of Public Health organized a reactive vaccination campaign against cholera to address the high mortality rate in the affected health districts. The first round was in August 2020 and the second in March 2021. We conducted a cross-sectional study and reviewed this vaccination campaign's challenges, best practices, and lessons. The vaccination coverage for the two doses of the oral cholera vaccine was 80.4%, with a refusal rate as high as 67%. People 20 years and above recorded the lowest vaccination coverage. The main challenge was misinformation about the cholera vaccine. The best practice was thorough population sensitization through community actors. Conclusion: Proper communication will always brave the odds of hesitancy and favor mass population vaccination to thwart hesitancy and consolidate herd immunity. © 2022","Best practices; Cameroon; Challenges; COVID-19; Lessons learned; Oral Cholera Vaccine","Administration, Oral; Cameroon; Cholera; Cholera Vaccines; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mass Vaccination; Pandemics; Vaccination; cholera vaccine; cholera vaccine; adolescent; adult; Article; case fatality rate; child; cholera; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; diarrhea; epidemic; female; geographic distribution; human; immunization; male; mass immunization; misinformation; pandemic; risk assessment; therapeutic misconception; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy; vomiting; Cameroon; cholera; mass immunization; oral drug administration; pandemic; prevention and control; vaccination"

While the underlying reasons are unclear, they are likely to be associated with myths and misinformation about the vaccines. Direct and indirect factors that deter minority mothers in the US from receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines require further investigation. Here, we examine the historical perspectives on vaccinations during pregnancy. We will examine the following aspects: (1) the influenza and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccinations during pregnancy; (2) the exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from COVID-19 vaccine trials; (3) COVID-19 vaccine safety during pregnancy, obstetric complications associated with symptomatic COVID-19 during pregnancy, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among pregnant minority women, and racial disparities experienced by pregnant minority women due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as their potential impact on pregnancy care; and (4) strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake among pregnant minority women in the US. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among minority mothers can be mitigated by community engagement efforts that focus on COVID-19 vaccine education, awareness campaigns by trusted entities, and COVID-19-appropriate perinatal counseling aimed to improve COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; influenza; minorities; pregnancy; Tdap; vaccinations; vaccine hesitancy; women","diphtheria toxoid; influenza vaccine; pertussis vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; Rotavirus vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tetanus toxoid; artificial ventilation; Bordetella pertussis; breast feeding; Clostridium tetani; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; counseling; diphtheria; education; fatigue; female; fever; geographic distribution; headache; health care cost; health care personnel; health care system; health care utilization; health insurance; health promotion; human; humoral immunity; immunization; immunogenicity; maternal death; maternal morbidity; mortality; mother; myalgia; nausea and vomiting; newborn death; pandemic; pertussis; pneumonia; preeclampsia; prenatal care; prevalence; public health insurance; Review; syphilis; systematic review; tetanus; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; vomiting"

Waning public confidence in vaccines, especially the COVID-19 vaccine, remains a cause for concern. A number of individuals in the US and worldwide remain complacent, choosing not to be vaccinated and/or delay COVID-19 vaccination, resulting in suboptimal herd immunity. The primary goal of this study is to identify modifiable factors contributing to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among vaccine-eligible individuals with access to vaccines in two under-resourced rural states, Alaska and Idaho. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with providers and focus groups with community participants in Alaska and Idaho. A moderator’s guide was used to facilitate interviews and focus groups conducted and recorded using Zoom and transcribed verbatim. Thematic, qualitative analysis was conducted using QDA Miner. Themes and subthemes that emerged were labeled, categorized, and compared to previously described determinants of general vaccine hesitancy: established contextual, individual and/or social influences, vaccine and vaccination-specific concerns. Themes (n = 9) and sub-themes (n = 51) identified during the qualitative analysis highlighted a factor’s contributing to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and poor vaccine uptake. Relevant influenceable factors were grouped into three main categories: confidence, complacency, and convenience. Vaccines are effective public health interventions to promote health and prevent diseases in rural areas. Practical solutions to engage healthcare providers, researchers, vaccine advocates, vaccine manufacturers, and other partners in local communities are needed to increase public trust in immunization systems to achieve community immunity. © 2022, The Author(s).","",""

Methods Consecutive RA patients on immunosuppressive therapies, with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or high-risk contact, vaccinated with 2 doses SARS-CoV-2 mRNA, BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, or viral vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were recruited during their routine rheumatology consultation. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG spike-specific antibodies were quantified at 1, 3 and 6 months respectively following the second vaccine dose. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection postvaccination during this 6-month longitudinal study was also assessed. Results Of the 104 RA patients included, 79 patients completed the 6-month trial follow-up. A significant decrease in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG titres was observed between 1-month and 3-month postvaccination (p<0.01). Among the 46 patients (46/79) receiving a booster dose, all developed detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibodies at the 6-month follow-up with significantly higher titres compared to 1-month (p<0.001) and 3-month (p<0.0001) post-vaccination. Conversely, the antibody titres among the 33 patients (33/79) not receiving a booster dose decreased significantly at the 6-month follow-up compared to 1-month (p<0.0001) and 3-month (p<0.01) post-vaccination. The incidence of COVID-19 disease postvaccination was 8.9% without severe forms. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibody kinetics postvaccination and the effect of a booster dose in a cohort of RA patients. The latter is essential given the waning humoral immunity observed in vaccinated RA patients and the increased incidence of COVID-19 diseases postvaccination in this 6-month longitudinal study. © Copyright CliniCal and ExpErimEntal rhEumatology 2023.","booster immunisation; coronavirus; humoral immune response; rheumatoid arthritis; vaccination","Antibodies, Viral; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; BNT162 Vaccine; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Immunoglobulin G; Longitudinal Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; elasomeran; glucocorticoid; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunosuppressive agent; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike specific protein; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; unclassified drug; vaxzevria; virus spike protein; immunoglobulin G; vaccine; virus antibody; adult; antibody titer; Article; Belgium; booster dose; booster immunization; clinical trial; cohort analysis; consultation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cumulative incidence; data collection method; demographics; drug dose regimen; female; follow up; hospital department; hospitalization; human; humoral immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; immunosuppressive treatment; informed consent; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; medical record; nonhuman; patient assessment; patient history of therapy; period prevalence; prospective study; public health campaign; revaccination; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatologist; SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibody kinetics postvaccination; secondary immune response; secondary immunization; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination coverage; vaccination reaction; virus load; virus spike; humoral immunity; rheumatoid arthritis; vaccination"

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Turkey. The participants aged 18 and older were recruited between December, 2020 and January, 2021 through conventional social media sites. Snowball sampling was used. An anonymous questionnaire consisted of demographics, vaccination experiences, and perceived risk of coronavirus disease. Results: 1202 women and 651 men were included in the data analysis. Findings showed that demographics, vaccination experience, and perceived risk of getting COVID-19 were explained. 37% of the variance in people's willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccination was according to hierarchical logistic regression. Furthermore, increasing age, being male, acquiring positive information about COVID-19 vaccines, having a lower level of vaccine hesitancy, the high level of worry about COVID-19, and low level of perceptions of the possibility of becoming infected by the COVID-19 were the main predictors of COVID-19 vaccine willingness. Conclusions: Factors affecting adults' willingness to be inoculated with COVID-19 vaccines were related to demographics, vaccination experiences, and perceived risk of getting COVID-19. We recommend that public health authorities and practitioners should consider these multiple factors regarding vaccine confidence to achieve herd immunity.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Vaccination is a major strategy for preventing infections. However, some new vaccines have an unmet need for impairing responses in certain individuals, especially COVID-19 vaccines, despite ongoing vaccine and adjuvant research. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a bioactive polysaccharide extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus as an immune adjuvant to regulate the efficacy of influenza split vaccine (ISV) and recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Cov-2 vaccine in mice. Our data indicated that APS as an adjuvant can facilitate the induction of high levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer and specific antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG) and confer protection against the lethal challenge of influenza A viruses, including increased survival and amelioration of weight loss in mice immunized with the ISV. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that the NF-κB and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis signaling pathways are essential for the immune response of mice immunized with the recombinant SARS-Cov-2 vaccine (RSV). Another important finding was that bidirectional immunomodulation of APS on cellular and humoral immunity was observed, and APS-adjuvant-induced antibodies persisted at a high level for at least 20 weeks. These findings suggest that APS is a potent adjuvant for influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, and has the advantages of bidirectional immunoregulation and persistent immunity. © 2023 The Authors","Adjuvant; Astragalus polysaccharide; Immunomodulation; Influenza vaccine; Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccine","Adjuvants, Immunologic; Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Mice; Polysaccharides; SARS-CoV-2; adjuvant; aluminum potassium sulfate; Astragalus extract; hemagglutinin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; polysaccharide; recombinant vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; immunological adjuvant; influenza vaccine; pharmaceutical vehicles and additives; polysaccharide; virus antibody; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Astragalus membranaceus; blood sampling; body weight loss; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Fc gamma R mediated phagocytosis; female; flow cytometry; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; immunomodulation; immunophenotyping; influenza; Influenza A virus; lymphocyte proliferation; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; phagocytosis; randomized controlled trial; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequencing; severe acute respiratory syndrome; T lymphocyte; animal; human; prevention and control"

Initial estimates in 2020 found that children were less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more likely to be asymptomatic or display mild COVID-19 symptoms. Our early understanding of COVID-19 transmission and disease in children led to a range of public health measures including school closures that have indirectly impacted child health and wellbeing. The emergence of variants of concern (particularly Delta and Omicron) has raised new issues about transmissibility in children, as preliminary data suggest that children may be at increased risk of infection, especially if unvaccinated. Global national prevalence data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents is rising due to COVID-19 vaccination among adults and increased circulation of Delta and Omicron variants. To mitigate this, childhood immunisation programmes are being implemented globally to prevent direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 including severe complications (e.g., MIS-C), debilitating long-COVID symptoms, and the indirect impacts of prolonged community and school closures on childhood education, social and behavioural development and mental health. This review explores the current state of knowledge on COVID-19 in children including COVID-19 vaccination strategies.

Specific comorbidities, as well as sociodemographic and lifestyle factors that may be more prevalent in underserved areas, have been identified as risk factors for COVID-19 infection or associated adverse outcomes. Dynamics of infections and deaths in Latin America have varied by country and temporally, as has SARS-CoV-2 variant prevalence; however, more recently, the Delta and subsequent Omicron variants have become ubiquitous. Successful pandemic responses have involved robust infection mitigation measures, testing, and smart deployment of healthcare resourcing. While in some Latin American countries up to 90% of the population is fully vaccinated (i.e., 2 doses) against COVID-19, other countries have failed to reach the World Health Organization’s 70% target. Continued focus on comprehensive surveillance, strategies to maximize vaccine availability and uptake, and mitigation of collateral damage on other aspects of public health and social services are critical for managing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Health workers were among the first to get a booster shoot. However, they may experience side effects after vaccination. We aimed to describe side effects of Moderna vaccine as a booster in health workers. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on health workers who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccine booster (Moderna) at Sulianti Saroso Infectious Disease Hospital, Indonesia and had filled the questionnaire assessing side effects form. We associated the form of the questionnaire assessing side effects from the originat-ing source of hospital immunization unit in September 2021. Results: A total of 101 health workers who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccine booster in Jul-Aug 2021 were included. Most of health worker experienced more than 3 side effects. The side effects were sore arm (100%); chills (72%); fatigue (57%); headache (53%) and fever (51%), other symptoms (28%). The side effects mostly happened a day of receiving a booster shot (61.4%). There was no association between age, gender, comorbid to amount of side effects (P>0.05).

Cancer patients on active treatment remain at an increased risk of developing breakthrough infections because of waning immunity and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. There is a paucity of data on the effects of COVID-19 outbreaks on long-term survival outcomes in this population. (2) Methods: We enrolled 230 cancer patients who were on active treatment for advanced disease and had received booster dosing of an mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine as part of the Vax-On-Third trial between September 2021 and October 2021. Four weeks after the third immunization, IgG antibodies against the spike receptor domain of SARS-CoV-2 were tested in all patients. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of breakthrough infections and disease outcomes. The coprimary endpoints were the effects of antibody titers on the development of breakthrough infections and the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks on cancer treatment failure. (3) Results: At a median follow-up of 16.3 months (95% CI 14.5–17.0), 85 (37%) patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospitalization was required in 11 patients (12.9%) and only 2 (2.3%) deaths related to COVID-19 outbreaks were observed. Median antibody titers were significantly lower in breakthrough cases than in non-cases (291 BAU/mL (95% CI 210–505) vs. 2798 BAU/mL (95% CI 2323–3613), p < 0.001). A serological titer cut-off below 803 BAU/mL was predictive of breakthrough infection. In multivariate testing, antibody titers and cytotoxic chemotherapy were independently associated with an increased risk of outbreaks. Time-to-treatment failure after booster dosing was significantly shorter in patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection (3.1 months (95% CI 2.3–3.6) vs. 16.2 months (95% CI 14.3–17.0), p < 0.001) and had an antibody level below the cut-off (3.6 months (95% CI 3.0–4.5) vs. 14.6 months (95% CI 11.9–16.3), p < 0.001). A multivariate Cox regression model confirmed that both covariates independently had a worsening effect on time-to-treatment failure. (4) Conclusions: These data support the role of vaccine boosters in preventing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks. Enhanced humoral immunity after the third vaccination significantly correlates with protection against breakthrough infections. Strategies aimed at restraining SARS-CoV-2 transmission in advanced cancer patients undergoing active treatment should be prioritized to mitigate the impact on disease outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.","active treatment; advanced disease; breakthrough infection; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; solid tumors; third dose; tozinameran; vaccination","Antibody Formation; BNT162 Vaccine; Breakthrough Infections; COVID-19; COVID-19 breakthrough infections; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Neoplasms; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; corticosteroid; immune checkpoint inhibitor; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; bnt 162 vaccine; dibutadiamine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; advanced cancer; antibody response; antibody titer; antiviral activity; area under the curve; Article; brain cancer; breast cancer; cancer patient; chemotherapy; clinical trial; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotoxicity; diagnostic test accuracy study; ECOG Performance Status; female; female genital tract cancer; follow up; head and neck cancer; hormonal therapy; hospitalization; human; humoral immunity; immunization; immunocompromised patient; incidence; kidney cancer; long term survival; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; melanoma; merkel cell carcinoma; middle aged; molecularly targeted therapy; observational study; outcome assessment; pancreas cancer; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; prospective study; prostate cancer; public health; receiver operating characteristic; receptor binding; revaccination; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; solid tumor; stomach cancer; time to treatment; transitional cell carcinoma; treatment failure; vaccination; variant of concern; virus spike; antibody production; breakthrough infection; coronavirus disease 2019; neoplasm; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"

In order to effectively deal with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, it becomes meaningful to further enhance the immune responses of individuals who have completed the first-generation vaccination. To understand whether sequential administration using different variant sequence-based inactivated vaccines could induce better immunity against the forthcoming variants, we tried five inactivated vaccine combinations in a mouse model and compared their immune responses. Our results showed that the sequential strategies have a significant advantage over homologous immunization by inducing robust antigen-specific T cell immune responses in the early stages of immunization. Furthermore, the three-dose vaccination strategies in our research elicited better neutralizing antibody responses against the BA.2 Omicron strain. These data provide scientific clues for finding the optimal strategy within the existing vaccine platform in generating cross-immunity against multiple variants including previously unexposed strains. © 2023 by the authors.","B cell response; inactivated; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2; T cell response; vaccine","CD19 antigen; CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; epitope; gamma interferon; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; receptor binding domain; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; antibody titer; Article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; cytopathogenic effect; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; flow cytometry; ID50; immune response; immunization; mouse; nonhuman; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2 Gamma; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; vaccination; Vero cell line"

Rapid viral antigenic evolution has led to the continual generation of new variants. Of special note is the recently expanding Omicron subvariants that are capable of immune evasion from most of the existing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). This has posed new challenges for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, exploring broad-spectrum antiviral agents to combat the emerging variants is imperative. In sharp contrast to the massive accumulation of mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), the S2 fusion subunit has remained highly conserved among variants. Hence, S2-based therapeutics may provide effective cross-protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we summarize the most recently developed broad-spectrum fusion inhibitors (e.g., nAbs, peptides, proteins, and small-molecule compounds) and candidate vaccines targeting the conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit. The main focus includes all the targetable S2 elements, namely, the fusion peptide, stem helix, and heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1-HR2) bundle. Moreover, we provide a detailed summary of the characteristics and action-mechanisms for each class of cross-reactive fusion inhibitors, which should guide and promote future design of S2-based inhibitors and vaccines against new coronaviruses. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Amino Acid Sequence; COVID-19; Humans; Peptides; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; 25 hydroxycholesterol; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; coronavirus fusion inhibitor; DNA vaccine; epitope; evolocumab; hemagglutinin; Human immunodeficiency virus fusion inhibitor; influenza vaccine; itraconazole; lopinavir; neutralizing antibody; palmitic acid; posaconazole; ritonavir; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; STAT5 protein; transmembrane protease serine 2; unclassified drug; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; peptide; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; adaptive immunity; antiviral activity; binding affinity; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; Chlamydia trachomatis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cross protection; cytotoxicity; disease severity; endocytosis; Escherichia coli; glycosylation; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; humoral immunity; hydrogen bond; IC50; immune evasion; immune response; immunization; immunogenicity; LD50; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; protein domain; protein structure; receptor binding; Review; SARS coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; sequence homology; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Syrian hamster; systematic review; thermostability; vaccination; virus neutralization; virus transmission; amino acid sequence; coronavirus disease 2019; genetics"

Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may show a range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, or they may show no symptoms at all. To treat COVID-19 symptoms and avoid serious infections, many medications and vaccinations have been employed. However, to entirely eradicate COVID-19 from the world, next-generation vaccine research is required because of the devastating consequences it is having for humanity and every nation’s economy. Scientists are working hard to eradicate this dangerous virus across the world. SARS-CoV-2 has also undergone significant mutation, leading to distinct viral types such as the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron variants. This has sparked discussion about the effectiveness of current vaccines for the newly formed variants. A proper comparison of these vaccinations is required to compare their efficacy as the number of people immunized against SARS-CoV-2 globally increases. Population-level statistics evaluating the capacity of these vaccines to reduce infection are therefore being developed. In this paper, we analyze the many vaccines on the market in terms of their production process, price, dosage needed, and efficacy. This article also discusses the challenges of achieving herd immunity, the likelihood of reinfection, and the importance of convalescent plasma therapy in reducing infection.

We report VE in Hungary, estimated with the screening method, in 2021, covering a period of Alpha and the Delta variant, including the booster dose roll-out. Hungary is in a unique position to use six different vaccines in the same population. All vaccines provided a high level of protection initially, which declined over time. While the picture is different in each age group, the waning of immunity is apparent for all vaccines, especially in the younger age groups and the Sinopharm, Sputnik-V, and AstraZeneca vaccines, which performed similarly. This is clearly reversed by booster doses, more prominent for those three vaccines, where the decline in protection is more evident. Overall, two vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, tend to produce the best results in all age groups, even with waning immunity considered. Using the screening method in future pandemic waves is worthwhile, especially in countries struggling with a lack of resources or when there is a need to deliver VE results within a short timeframe due to urgent decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; Hungary; SARS-CoV-2; screening method; surveillance; vaccine effectiveness; waning immunity","ad26.cov2.s vaccine; covilo; RNA vaccine; sputnik v vaccine; tozinameran; vaccine; vaxzevria; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; clinical monitoring; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; disease surveillance; drug efficacy; human; immune response; immunity; immunization; laboratory diagnosis; pandemic; physician; population size; public health; reliability; risk factor; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; screening test; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; simulation; vaccination; validation process"

We sought to investigate how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination affected the course of these outbreaks. Methods: We used an agent-based model of disease transmission to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks in Nunavut. The model encapsulated demographics and household structure of the population, the effect of NPIs, and daily number of vaccine doses administered. We fitted the model to inferred, back-calculated infections from incidence data reported from October 2020 to June 2021. We then compared the fit of the scenario based on case count data with several counterfactual scenarios without the effect of NPIs, without vaccination, and with a hypothetical accelerated vaccination program whereby 98% of the vaccine supply was administered to eligible individuals. Results: We found that, without a territory-wide lockdown during the first COVID-19 outbreak in November 2020, the peak of infections would have been 4.7 times higher with a total of 5,404 (95% CrI: 5,015—5,798) infections before the start of vaccination on January 6, 2021. Without effective NPIs, we estimated a total of 4,290 (95% CrI: 3,880—4,708) infections during the second outbreak under the pace of vaccination administered in Nunavut. In a hypothetical accelerated vaccine rollout, the total infections during the second Nunavut outbreak would have been 58% lower, to 1,812 (95% CrI: 1,593—2,039) infections. Vaccination was estimated to have the largest impact during the outbreak in April 2021, averting 15,196 (95% CrI: 14,798—15,591) infections if the disease had spread through Nunavut communities. Accelerated vaccination would have further reduced the total infections to 243 (95% CrI: 222—265) even in the absence of NPIs. Conclusions: NPIs have been essential in mitigating pandemic outbreaks in this large, geographically distanced and remote territory. While vaccination has the greatest impact to prevent infection and severe outcomes, public health implementation of NPIs play an essential role in the short term before attaining high levels of immunity in the population. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agent-based simulations; COVID-19; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination","Canada; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Nunavut; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; vaccine; Canada; communicable disease control; epidemic; epidemiology; human; Nunavut; prevention and control; vaccination"

However, in the era of highly transmissible variants, whether it is possible for China to sustain a local containment policy and under what conditions China could transition away from it are of paramount importance at the current stage of the pandemic. Methods: We developed a spatially structured, fully stochastic, individual-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission model to evaluate the feasibility of sustaining SARS-CoV-2 local containment in mainland China considering the Omicron variants, China’s current immunization level, and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We also built a statistical model to estimate the overall disease burden under various hypothetical mitigation scenarios. Results: We found that due to high transmissibility, neither Omicron BA.1 nor BA.2 could be contained by China’s pre-Omicron NPI strategies which were successful prior to the emergence of the Omicron variants. However, increased intervention intensity, such as enhanced population mobility restrictions and multi-round mass testing, could lead to containment success. We estimated that an acute Omicron epidemic wave in mainland China would result in significant number of deaths if China were to reopen under current vaccine coverage with no antiviral uptake, while increasing vaccination coverage and antiviral uptake could substantially reduce the disease burden. Conclusions: As China’s current vaccination has yet to reach high coverage in older populations, NPIs remain essential tools to maintain low levels of infection while building up protective population immunity, ensuring a smooth transition out of the pandemic phase while minimizing the overall disease burden. © 2022, The Author(s).","Containment; COVID-19; Mitigation; Nonpharmaceutical interventions; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant; Vaccination","Aged; China; COVID-19; Feasibility Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; antivirus agent; coronavac; neutralizing antibody; adult; aged; Article; biocontainment; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; feasibility study; health care facility; health care personnel; hospitalization; human; immune evasion; interview; mathematical model; middle aged; occupation; occupational exposure; public health; SARS-CoV-2 (lineage BA.1); SARS-CoV-2 (lineage BA.2); SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; sensitivity analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stochastic model; vaccination coverage; virus transmission; workplace; epidemiology; feasibility study; genetics; prevention and control"

Constructing a reliable mathematical model helps us quantitatively explain the kinetic characteristics of antibody-virus interactions. A novel and robust model is developed to integrate antibody dynamics with virus dynamics based on a comprehensive understanding of immunology principles. This model explicitly formulizes the pernicious effect of the antibody, together with a positive feedback stimulation of the virus–antibody complex on the antibody regeneration. Besides providing quantitative insights into antibody and virus dynamics, it demonstrates good adaptivity in recapturing the virus-antibody interaction. It is proposed that the environmental antigenic substances help maintain the memory cell level and the corresponding neutralizing antibodies secreted by those memory cells. A broader application is also visualized in predicting the antibody protection time caused by a natural infection. Suitable binding antibodies and the presence of massive environmental antigenic substances would prolong the protection time against breakthrough infection. The model also displays excellent fitness and provides good explanations for antibody selection, antibody interference, and self-reinfection. It helps elucidate how our immune system efficiently develops neutralizing antibodies with good binding kinetics. It provides a reasonable explanation for the lower SARS-CoV-2 mortality in the population that was vaccinated with other vaccines. It is inferred that the best strategy for prolonging the vaccine protection time is not repeated inoculation but a directed induction of fast-binding antibodies. Eventually, this model will inform the future construction of an optimal mathematical model and help us fight against those infectious diseases. © 2023 by the authors.","antibody dynamics; mathematical modeling; protection time; SARS-CoV-2; vaccine","Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Communicable Diseases; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adaptive immunity; amino acid sequence; antibody response; antibody screening; Article; binding affinity; binding kinetics; bioinformatics; breakthrough infection; cell level; cell proliferation; communicable disease; gene editing; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; immunology; inoculation; mathematical model; memory cell; mortality; nonhuman; positive feedback; prediction; protection time; regeneration; reinfection; seroprevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; steady state; T lymphocyte; time series analysis; vaccination; virus load; virus replication; communicable disease; prevention and control"

To help address some of the main problems, the scientific community has designed vaccines, diagnostic tools and therapeutics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The rapid pace of technology development, especially with regard to vaccines, represents a stunning and historic scientific achievement. Nevertheless, many challenges remain to be overcome, such as improving vaccine and drug treatment efficacies for emergent mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Outbreaks of more infectious variants continue to diminish the utility of available vaccines and drugs. Thus, the effectiveness of vaccines and drugs against the most current variants is a primary consideration in the continual analyses of clinical data that supports updated regulatory decisions. The first two vaccines granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, still show more than 60% protection efficacy against the most widespread current SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron. This variant carries more than 30 mutations in the spike protein, which has largely abrogated the neutralizing effects of therapeutic antibodies. Fortunately, some neutralizing antibodies and antiviral COVID-19 drugs treatments have shown continued clinical benefits. In this review, we provide a framework for understanding the ongoing development efforts for different types of vaccines and therapeutics, including small molecule and antibody drugs. The ripple effects of newly emergent variants, including updates to vaccines and drug repurposing efforts, are summarized. In addition, we summarize the clinical trials supporting the development and distribution of vaccines, small molecule drugs, and therapeutic antibodies with broad-spectrum activity against SARS-CoV-2 strains. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; mRNA vaccines; Neutralizing antibodies; SARS-CoV-2; Small molecule antiviral drugs; Therapeutics; Vaccine development","Antiviral Agents; BNT162 Vaccine; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Viral Vaccines; antivirus agent; bebtelovimab; cilgavimab plus tixagevimab; ensitrelvir; lipid nanoparticle; messenger RNA; molnupiravir; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; nirmatrelvir; remdesivir; virus spike protein; antivirus agent; virus vaccine; antibody response; biodegradation; coronavirus disease 2019; crystallization; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug metabolism; Ebolavirus; emergency use authorization; encapsulation; genetic model; glycosylation; hospitalization; human; immune response; immunization; innate immunity; pandemic; phagocytosis; prevalence; protein expression; protein synthesis; public health; Review; RNA sequence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; vaccine development; virus load; virus neutralization; virus replication; drug therapy; prevention and control"

We aimed to provide an overall picture of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, including policy, coverage, and demand of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We conducted a descriptive study of vaccination policy and doses administered data obtained from multiple public sources as of 8 February 2022. We used these data to develop coverage indicators and explore associations of vaccine coverage with socioeconomic and healthcare-related factors. We estimated vaccine demand as numbers of doses required to complete vaccination of countries’ target populations according to their national immunization program policies. Results: Messenger RNA and adenovirus vectored vaccines were the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines in high-income countries, while adenovirus vectored vaccines were the most widely used vaccines worldwide (180 countries). One hundred ninety-two countries have authorized vaccines for the general public, with 40.1% (77/192) targeting individuals over 12 years and 32.3% (62/192) targeting those ≥ 5 years. Forty-eight and 151 countries have started additional-dose and booster-dose vaccination programs, respectively. Globally, there have been 162.1 doses administered per 100 individuals in target populations, with marked inter-region and inter-country heterogeneity. Completed vaccination series coverage ranged from 0.1% to more than 95.0% of country target populations, and numbers of doses administered per 100 individuals in target populations ranged from 0.2 to 308.6. Doses administered per 100 individuals in whole populations correlated with healthcare access and quality index (R2 = 0.59), socio-demographic index (R2 = 0.52), and gross domestic product per capita (R2 = 0.61). At least 6.4 billion doses will be required to complete interim vaccination programs—3.3 billion for primary immunization and 3.1 billion for additional/booster programs. Globally, 0.53 and 0.74 doses per individual in target populations are needed for primary immunization and additional/booster dose programs, respectively. Conclusions: There is wide country-level disparity and inequity in COVID-19 vaccines rollout, suggesting large gaps in immunity, especially in low-income countries. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19 vaccines; Global diversity; Vaccination policy; Vaccine coverage; Vaccine demand","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunization Programs; Policy; Vaccination Coverage; RNA vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vector vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; descriptive research; global health; gross national product; health care; health care need; health care policy; Healthcare Access and Quality Index; high income country; human; immunization; preventive health service; socioeconomics; vaccination; vaccination coverage; epidemiology; policy; prevention and control; vaccination coverage"

These measures successfully suppressed the community transmission of pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants or lineages during the first to the fourth wave. No nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented among healthcare workers in the first 300 days. The strategy of COVID-19 containment was adopted to provide additional time to achieve population immunity by vaccination. The near-zero COVID-19 situation for about 8 months in 2021 did not enable adequate immunization of the eligible population. A combination of factors was identified, especially population complacency associated with the low local COVID-19 activity, together with vaccine hesitancy. The importation of the highly transmissible Omicron variant kickstarted the fifth wave of COVID-19, which could no longer be controlled by our initial measures. The explosive fifth wave, which was partially contributed by vertical airborne transmission in high-rise residential buildings, resulted in over one million cases of infection.

Aside from this, other concerns in mass immunization settings are also the scalability of production and relative affordability of the technology. In that regard, adjuvanted protein vaccines with particles mimicking the virus stand out among known vaccine technologies. The “Betuvax-CoV-2” vaccine, developed on the basis of a recombinant protein and an adjuvant, has already been tested in preclinical studies and has advanced to clinical evaluation. Open, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized phase I/II clinical trial of the “Betuvax-CoV-2,” recombinant protein subunit vaccine based on the S-protein RBD fused with the Fc-fragment of IgG, was conducted to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in response to the vaccination. Methods: In the phase I/II clinical trial, 116 healthy adult men and women, ages 18–58, were enrolled: 20 in Stage I, and 96 in Stage II. In Stage I, 20 µg of the vaccine was administered intramuscularly on day 2, and either 5 µg (group 1) or 20 µg (group 2) on day 30. In Stage II, 20 µg of the vaccine was administered intramuscularly on day 2, and either 5 µg (group 3) or 20 µg (group 4) on day 30. In group 5, both injections were replaced with placebo. The primary outcome measures were safety (number of participants with adverse events throughout the study) and antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA and CMIA). Antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity and changes in neutralizing antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay) were measured as a secondary outcome. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Study Identifier: NCT05270954). Findings: Both vaccine formulations (20 µg + 5 µg and 20 µg + 20 µg) were safe and well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild, and no serious adverse events were detected. On day 51,anti-SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG antibody titers and anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher in the vaccine groups (both formulations) than in the placebo. A more pronounced CD4+-mediated immune response was observed in the group of volunteers administered with the 20 + 20 μg vaccine formulation. Interpretations: RBD-Fc-based COVID-19 “Betuvax-CoV-2” vaccine in doses (20 + 5 µg and 20 + 20 µg) demonstrated an excellent safety profile and induced a strong humoral response. Further research on the protective effectiveness of the “Betuvax-CoV-2” vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 is on its way. © 2023 by the authors.","betulin; Betuvax-CoV-2; clinical trial; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; subunit vaccine","gamma interferon; interleukin 2; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; allergy; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; cytokine production; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug safety; drug tolerability; enterocolitis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epilepsy; flow cytometry; gastroenteritis; human; human experiment; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; immunogenicity; middle aged; normal human; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; randomized controlled trial; tonsillitis; urinalysis; vaccine immunogenicity"

The emergence of numerous SARS-CoV-2 has heightened public concern regarding the future course of the epidemic. Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has rapidly become globally dominant in the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high infectivity and immune evasion. Consequently, vaccination implementation is critically significant. However, growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccination may cause new-onset autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune glomerulonephritis, autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and autoimmune hepatitis. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and these autoimmune diseases remains to be demonstrated. In this review, we provide evidence that vaccination induces autoimmunity and summarize possible mechanisms of action, such as molecular mimicry, activation by bystanders, and adjuvants. Our objective is not to refute the importance of vaccines, but to raise awareness about the potential risks of COVID-19 vaccination. In fact, we believe that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the possible risks and encourage people to get vaccinated. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Autoimmune diseases; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines","adjuvant; neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; phospholipid antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult onset Still disease; alopecia areata; ANCA associated vasculitis; antiphospholipid syndrome; autoimmune disease; autoimmune hemolytic anemia; autoimmune hepatitis; autoimmune thyroiditis; autoimmunity; awareness; B lymphocyte activation; Behcet disease; bystander effect (cell); coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; drug safety; drug tolerability; giant cell arteritis; Guillain Barre syndrome; human; immunization; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; immunoreactivity; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lupus erythematosus nephritis; membranous glomerulonephritis; molecular mimicry; myocarditis; polyclonal activation; Review; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Sjoegren syndrome; vaccination; vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia; virus immunity"

In England, voluntary “plan B” mitigation measures were introduced in December 2021 including increased home working and face coverings in shops but stopped short of restrictions on social contacts. The impact of voluntary risk mitigation behaviours on future SARS-CoV-2 burden is unknown. Methods: We developed a rapid online survey of risk mitigation behaviours ahead of the winter 2021 festive period and deployed in two longitudinal cohort studies in the UK (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and TwinsUK/COVID Symptom Study (CSS) Biobank) in December 2021. Using an individual-based, probabilistic model of COVID-19 transmission between social contacts with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant parameters and realistic vaccine coverage in England, we predicted the potential impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron wave in England in terms of the effective reproduction number and cumulative infections, hospital admissions and deaths. Using survey results, we estimated in real-time the impact of voluntary risk mitigation behaviours on the Omicron wave in England, if implemented for the entire epidemic wave. Results: Over 95% of survey respondents (NALSPAC = 2686 and NTwins = 6155) reported some risk mitigation behaviours, with vaccination and using home testing kits reported most frequently. Less than half of those respondents reported that their behaviour was due to “plan B”. We estimate that without risk mitigation behaviours, the Omicron variant is consistent with an effective reproduction number between 2.5 and 3.5. Due to the reduced vaccine effectiveness against infection with the Omicron variant, our modelled estimates suggest that between 55% and 60% of the English population could be infected during the current wave, translating into between 12,000 and 46,000 cumulative deaths, depending on assumptions about severity and vaccine effectiveness. The actual number of deaths was 15,208 (26 November 2021–1 March 2022). We estimate that voluntary risk reduction measures could reduce the effective reproduction number to between 1.8 and 2.2 and reduce the cumulative number of deaths by up to 24%. Conclusions: Predicting future infection burden is affected by uncertainty in disease severity and vaccine effectiveness estimates. In addition to biological uncertainty, we show that voluntary measures substantially reduce the projected impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant but that voluntary measures alone would be unlikely to completely control transmission. © 2023, The Author(s).","Behaviour change; Infectious disease modelling; Interventions; Longitudinal cohort studies; Omicron variant; policy; SARS-CoV-2; Scenario modelling","Child; COVID-19; England; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; SARS-CoV-2; United States; adult; aged; Article; behavior change; biobank; cohort analysis; communicable disease; coronavirus disease 2019; death toll; disease severity; disease transmission; effective reproduction number; England; Englishman; epidemic; female; health care planning; hospital admission; hospital infection; human; immune response; immunization; innate immunity; language; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mitigation; mortality; nonhuman; pathogen load; pregnancy; public health; risk reduction; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; self-testing; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social behavior; uncertainty; vaccination; virus transmission; winter; child; epidemiology; prevention and control; United States"

Vaccination is a crucial component in preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, despite the high risks associated with COVID-19, there is widespread disapproval and hostility towards vaccination and restrictive measures aimed at stopping the infection process. The spread of misinformation about vaccines, which has a long history as far back as the 18th and 19th centuries, increases distrust of immunization. This distrust is based on different beliefs about the origins of health and disease accepted in society. Vaccine skepticism is considered a global threat to public health and the achievement of population immunity against infections. Therefore, collection of data on attitudes towards vaccination within the largest possible number of social subgroups is warranted. AIM: To perform a systematic search and qualitative synthesis of scientific information on COVID-19 vaccination readiness among Russian-speaking residents in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan as well as associated factors. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to examine scientific articles published in Russian from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2022, that reported on the attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination among Russian-speaking residents of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. In total, there were more than 12,000 respondents in the selected papers that described the factors influencing the preparedness for COVID-19 immunization. The proportions of respondents who agreed, disagreed, and doubted the implementation of vaccination were recorded and used to calculate median values without taking into account the weights of each individual study. RESULTS: Compared to many other countries, the Russian-speaking residents in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan has demonstrated a reluctance to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with 30% expressing unwillingness and only 47% indicating readiness for vaccination. CONCLUSION: The use of theoretical models for describing health-related behavior is warranted to improve the quality and information content of Russian biomedical and socio-psychological research. This approach can aid in the development of effective interventions and preventive strategies for vaccine-preventable diseases. © Eco-Vector, 2023.","attitude to vaccination; coronavirus infection; COVID-19; pandemic; prevention; readiness for vaccination",""

We examined the sensitivity of Delta and Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4/5, and BA.3) to neutralizing antibodies from BBIBP-CorV-vaccinated and BBIBP-CorV- or ZF2001-boosted individuals, as well as individuals with Delta and BA.1 breakthrough infections, and determined their fusogenicity and infectivity. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, serum samples from two doses of BBIBP-CorV-vaccinated individuals 1 (n = 36), 3 (n = 36), and 7 (n = 37) months after the second dose; BBIBP-CorV- (n = 25) or ZF2001-boosted (n = 30) individuals; and fully vaccinated individuals with Delta (n = 30) or BA.1 (n = 26) infection were collected. The serum-neutralizing reactivity and potency of bebtelovimab were assessed against D614G, Delta, and Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4/5, and BA.3) through a pseudovirus neutralization assay. The fusogenicity and infectivity of D614G, Delta, and Omicron subvariants were determined by cell-cell fusion assay and pseudovirus infection assay, respectively. Results: Omicron subvariants markedly escaped vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies after two doses of BBIBP-CorV with comparable efficiency. A third dose vaccination of BBIBP-CorV or ZF2001 increased neutralizing antibody titers and breadth against Delta and three Omicron subvariants. Delta and BA.1 breakthrough infections induced comparable neutralizing antibody titers against D614G and Delta variants, whereas BA.1 breakthrough infections elicited a stronger and broader antibody response against three Omicron subvariants than Delta breakthrough infections. BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 are more resistant to immunity induced by breakthrough infections. Bebtelovimab had no significant loss of potency against the Delta and Omicron subvariants. Cell culture experiments showed Omicron subvariants to be less fusogenic and have higher infectivity than D614G and Delta with comparable efficiency. Conclusions: These findings have important public health implications and highlight the importance of repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens to broaden the neutralizing antibody response against Omicron subvariants. © 2022, The Author(s).","Breakthrough infection; Fusogenicity; Infectivity; Omicron subvariants; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination neutralization","Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Breakthrough Infections; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; bbibp corv; bebtelovimab; covilo; ly cov 1404; neutralizing antibody; zifivax; BIBP COVID-19 vaccine; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; ZF2001 COVID-19 vaccine; adult; antibody response; antibody titer; Article; blood sampling; breakthrough infection; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; drug potency; drug sensitivity; embryo; female; fusogenicity; human; human cell; male; nonhuman; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; vaccination; vaccinee; viral phenomena and functions; virus immunity; virus neutralization; virus neutralization test; virus virulence"

The model was calibrated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality between October 2020 and April 2021 (aggressive pandemic phase), and projected an extended outlook to estimate mortality during a less aggressive phase (April–August 2021). Simulated scenarios evaluated mAbs for averting infections and deaths in addition to vaccines and aggregated non-pharmaceutical interventions. Scenarios included mAbs as a treatment of COVID-19 and for passive immunity for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) during a period when variants were susceptible to the mAbs. Rapid diagnostic testing paired with mAbs was evaluated as an early treatment-as-prevention strategy. Sensitivity analyses included increasing mAb supply and vaccine rollout. Allocation of mAbs for use only as PEP averted up to 14% more infections than vaccine alone, and targeting individuals ≥ 65 years averted up to 37% more deaths. Rapid testing for earlier diagnosis and mAb use amplified these benefits. Doubling the mAb supply further reduced infections and mortality. mAbs provided benefits even as proportion of the immunized population increased. Model projections estimated that ~ 42% of expected deaths between April and August 2021 could be averted. Assuming sensitivity to mAbs, their use as early treatment and PEP in addition to vaccines would substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mortality even as vaccination increases and mortality decreases.

Vaccination rates have differed between countries, depending on supply (availability of resources) and demand (altruism and resistance to vaccination) factors. Methods: This work considers the hypothesis that individuals’ health altruism has been an important factor to explain the different levels of vaccination between countries, using the number of transplants as a proxy for altruism. Taking European Union’s countries to remove, as far as possible, supply factors that might affect vaccination, we carry out cross-sectional regressions for the most favorable date of the vaccination process (maximum vaccination speed) and for each month during the vaccination campaign. Results: Our findings confirm that altruism has affected vaccination rates against the COVID-19. We find a direct relationship between transplants rates (proxy variable) and vaccination rates during periods in which the decision to be vaccinated depended on the individual’s choice, without supply restrictions. The results show that other demand factors have worked against vaccination: political polarization and belonging to the group of countries of the former Eastern bloc. Conclusions: Altruism is a useful tool to define future vaccination strategies, since it favors the individuals’ awareness for vaccination. © 2022, The Author(s).","Altruism; COVID-19; hesitancy; Externality; Herd immunity; Public health; Vaccines","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; altruism; Article; awareness; behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; health care organization; health care policy; health promotion; herd immunity; mass immunization; polarization; population size; public health; scientific literature; socioeconomics; transplantation; vaccination; velocity"

Vaccine hesitancy is responsible for measles outbreaks in countries where measles had previously been eliminated, including in England, and is one of the ten threats to global public health identified by the World Health Organization (WHO). Official administrative 2012–2021 data on measles incidence and MMR coverage in England were reviewed alongside a scoping literature review on factors associated with MMR uptake in England. Whilst measles incidence has reduced significantly since 2012, sporadic measles outbreaks in England have occurred with geographic disparities and variations in MMR coverage. Over the last decade, MMR uptake has fallen across all regions with no area currently reaching the WHO target of 95% coverage of both doses of MMR necessary for herd immunity. Factors associated with MMR coverage overlap with the 3C (convenience, complacency and confidence) model of vaccine hesitancy. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced pre-existing vaccine hesitancy. Increasing MMR uptake by reducing vaccine hesitancy requires allocated funding for area-based and targeted domiciliary and community-specific immunisation services and interventions, public health catch-up campaigns and web-based decision aid tools. © 2023 by the authors.","3c model; England; health inequalities; measles; measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR); social inequalities; vaccine hesitancy","measles mumps rubella vaccine; Article; awareness; behavior change; biological accident; Child Health Information System; conceptual framework; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; disease severity assessment; disease transmission; education; England; geographic distribution; health care personnel; health deprivation; health disparity; health emergency; health program; health service; health workforce; herd immunity; human; immune response; incidence; lockdown; measles; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; nonhuman; nutrition; population density; population mobility; practice guideline; public health; social determinants of health; social media; socioeconomics; thermostability; training; trusted information; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy; World Health Organization"

Optimising vaccination efficacy, particularly for higher-risk individuals, like the elderly whose immunocompromised state can prevent the development of robust vaccine responses, is vital. It is now clear that 24-hour circadian rhythms, which govern virtually all aspects of physiology, can generate oscillations in immunological responses. Consequently, vaccine efficacy may depend critically on the time of day of administration(s), including for Covid-19, current vaccines, and any future diseases or pandemics. Published clinical vaccine trials exploring diurnal immune variations suggest this approach could represent a powerful adjunct strategy for optimising immunisation, but important questions remain to be addressed.

An ideal vaccine candidate for the prevention of outbreaks should be rapidly scalable, easy to administer, and able to elicit a potent mucosal immunity. Towards this aim, we proposed an engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) Nissle 1917 (EcN) strain with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP)-coding plasmid, which was able to expose SP on its cellular surface by a hybridization with the adhesin involved in diffuse adherence 1 (AIDA1). In this study, we presented the effectiveness of a 16-week intragastrically administered, engineered EcN in producing specific systemic and mucosal immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 SP in mice. We observed a time-dependent increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP IgG antibodies in the sera at week 4, with a titre that more than doubled by week 12 and a stable circulating titre by week 16 (+309% and +325% vs. control; both p < 0.001). A parallel rise in mucosal IgA antibody titre in stools, measured via intestinal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of the treated mice, reached a plateau by week 12 and until the end of the immunization protocol (+300, +47, and +150%, at week 16; all p < 0.001 vs. controls). If confirmed in animal models of infection, our data indicated that the engineered EcN may be a potential candidate as an oral vaccine against COVID-19. It is safe, inexpensive, and, most importantly, able to stimulate the production of both systemic and mucosal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein antibodies. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; engineered probiotics; IgA; oral vaccine","Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Antibody Formation; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Escherichia coli; Humans; Immunization; Mice; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; probiotic agent; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; virus spike protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; adverse event; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody response; Article; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; controlled study; dendritic cell; disease activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Escherichia coli; histopathology; immunofluorescence assay; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunoreactivity; male; mouse; mucosal immunity; nonhuman; plasma cell; protein expression; protein localization; risk assessment; Western blotting; animal; antibody production; Escherichia coli; genetics; human; immunization; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures"

Data on responsiveness to COVID-19 vaccination strategies and immunogenicity are limited, yet required to inform vaccination strategies in this at-risk population. Objective: The objective of this study is to characterize the longitudinal serologic response to COVID-19 vaccination. Design: This is a prospective observational cohort study. Setting: Participating outpatient kidney programs within Ontario and British Columbia. Patients: Up to 2500 participants with CKD G3b-5D receiving COVID-19 vaccination, including participants receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients (CKD G1T-5T). Measurements: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies (anti-spike, anti-receptor binding domain, anti-nucleocapsid) will be detected by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) from serum or dried blood spot testing. In a subset of participants, neutralizing antibodies against novel variants of concern will be evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected for exploratory immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity. Methods: Participants will be recruited prior to or following any COVID-19 vaccine dose and have blood sampled for serological testing at multiple timepoints: 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post vaccination. When possible, samples will be collected prior to a dose or booster. Participants will remain in the study for at least 1 year following their last COVID-19 vaccine dose. Strengths and limitations: The adaptive design of this study allows for planned modification based on emerging evidence or rapid changes in public health policy surrounding vaccination. Limitations include incomplete earlier timepoints for blood collection due to rapid vaccination of the population. Conclusions: This large multicenter serologic study of participants living with kidney disease will generate data on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 immune response to vaccination across the spectrum of CKD, providing insights into the amplitude and duration of immunity conferred by COVID-19 vaccination and allowing for characterization of factors associated with immune response. The results of this study may be used to inform immunization guidelines and public health recommendations for the 4 million Canadians living with CKD. © The Author(s) 2023.","chronic kidney disease; COVID-19; dialysis; serology; vaccine","ad26 cov2 s; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; elasomeran; gamma interferon; granzyme A; granzyme B; ibacovavec; immunoglobulin G antibody; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; neutralizing antibody; nucleocapsid protein; perforin; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; tumor necrosis factor; vaxzevria; adult; Article; blood sampling; cellular immunity; chronic kidney failure; clinical protocol; clinical research; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; dialysis; dried blood spot testing; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; glomerulus filtration rate; graft recipient; hospitalization; human; immune response; immunization; immunogenicity; infection rate; kidney graft; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; multiplex bead assay; observational study; pandemic; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; prospective study; public health; receptor binding; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination"

The partial immunity already offered by the first dose and the high levels of uncertainty in the vaccine supplies have been characteristic of most of the vaccination campaigns implemented worldwide and made the planning of such interventions extremely complex. Motivated by this compelling challenge, we propose a stochastic optimization framework for optimally scheduling a two-dose vaccination campaign in the presence of uncertain supplies, taking into account constraints on the interval between the two doses and on the capacity of the healthcare system. The proposed framework seeks to maximize the vaccination coverage, considering the different levels of immunization obtained with partial (one dose only) and complete vaccination (two doses). We cast the optimization problem as a convex second-order cone program, which can be efficiently solved through numerical techniques. We demonstrate the potential of our framework on a case study calibrated on the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy. The proposed method shows good performance when unrolled in a sliding-horizon fashion, thereby offering a powerful tool to help public health authorities calibrate the vaccination campaign, pursuing a trade-off between efficacy and the risk associated with shortages in supply. © 2022 The Author(s)","Conic programming and interior point methods; Epidemics; OR in medicine; Uncertainty modeling; Vaccination","Economic and social effects; Optimization; Public administration; Public health; Uncertainty analysis; Vaccines; Conic programming; Conic programming and interior point method; Dynamic planning; Interior-point method; OR in medicine; Time interval; Uncertain supplies; Uncertainty; Uncertainty models; Vaccine supplies; Health risks"

Here, we report the seroprevalence among infected and infection-naive residents and staff after the primary COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Among 1554 vaccinated nursing home residents and 1082 vaccinated staff from 69 nursing homes in Belgium, we assessed the proportion having SARS-CoV-2 antibodies approximately two (April 2021), four (June 2021), and six months (August 2021) after a two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We measured the seroprevalence using SARS-CoV-2 antibody rapid tests and collected socio-demographic and COVID-19 medical data using an online questionnaire. Two months after vaccination (baseline), we found a seroprevalence of 91% (95% CI: 89–93) among vaccinated residents and 99% (95% CI: 98–99) among vaccinated staff. Six months after vaccination, the seroprevalence significantly decreased to 68% (95% CI: 64–72) among residents and to 89% (95% CI; 86–91) among staff (p < 0.001). The seroprevalence was more likely to decrease among infection-naive residents, older residents, or residents with a high care dependency level. These findings emphasize the need for close monitoring of nursing home residents, as a substantial part of this population fails to mount a persistent antibody response after BNT162b2 vaccination. © 2022 by the authors.","BNT126b2; COVID-19 vaccination; elderly; IgG; IgM; nursing home residents; SARS-CoV-2; seroprevalence","Antibodies, Viral; Belgium; BNT162 Vaccine; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunization Programs; Nursing Homes; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Vaccination; elasomeran; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; tozinameran; virus antibody; adult; aged; antibody response; Article; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; daily life activity; demography; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; heart disease; human; humoral immunity; hypertension; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney disease; lung disease; major clinical study; male; nursing home; nursing home patient; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; prospective study; public health campaign; questionnaire; resident; seroprevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; vaccinee; x-ray computed tomography; Belgium; epidemiology; prevalence; prevention and control; preventive health service; seroepidemiology; vaccination"

We highlight the factors affecting VH, the role of VH in limiting vaccine uptake and inability to achieve collective immunity, and possible solutions. Recent Findings: There are still uncertainties and concerns about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, which promote VH and undermine public confidence in immunization. WHO has designed the behavioral and social drivers (BeSD) tools and survey instruments that can be used by countries to assess reasons for poor vaccine uptake in childhood for COVID-19 and plan national vaccination programs to counter these misconceptions. Summary: Vaccines are one of the best preventative measures that public health care has to offer. Evidence from across the world both in high-income countries (HICs) and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) show that VH is a significant phenomenon which is translating into geographical clustering of epidemics. A reasonably high acceptance and coverage rates are necessary for an immunization program to be successful. A context-specific and multifactorial intervention with more high-quality research is needed globally. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Behavioral and social drivers; Health literacy; Motivational interviewing; Multicomponent interventions; Vaccine hesitancy measurement; Vaccine uptake","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; attitude to health; child health care; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug safety; evidence based practice; global health; herd immunity; high income country; low income country; middle income country; patient compliance; Review; social behavior; therapeutic misconception; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy; World Health Organization"

After the Omicron BA.1/2 wave, we found few (< 6%) remained naïve to SARS-CoV-2 and the population immunologic landscape is fragmented with diverse infection/immunization histories. Prior infection with the ancestral strain, Beta, and Delta variants provided 13%, 34%, and 51% protection against Omicron BA.1/2 infection, respectively. Hybrid immunity and repeated prior infections reduced the risks of Omicron BA.1/2 infection by 60% and 85% respectively. Our study sheds light on a rapidly shifting landscape of population immunity in the Omicron era and provides context for anticipating the long-term circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in populations no longer naïve to the virus. © 2023, The Author(s).","","COVID-19; Humans; Prospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; South Africa; South Africa; ad 26cov 2s; bnt 162b 2; ibacovavec; tozinameran; disease severity; immunity; infectious disease; public health; serum; severe acute respiratory syndrome; adolescent; adult; antigenic escape; Article; attack rate; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; female; herd immunity; human; immune evasion; infant; infection rate; major clinical study; male; newborn; nonhuman; nose smear; primary infection; prospective study; reinfection; risk reduction; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; South Africa; epidemiology"

Neutralization levels induced by inactivated vaccines rapidly wane after primary immunization, and a homologous booster can recall specific immune memory, resulting in a remarkable increase in antibody concentration. The optimal interval between primary and booster doses has yet to be determined. What is added by this report? Booster doses given at three months or more after the two-dose regimen of the CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine in elderly individuals aged 60 years and older triggered good immune responses. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibody on Day 14 after the booster doses increased by 13.3–26.2 fold of baseline levels, reaching 105.45–193.59 in groups with different intervals (e.g., 3, 4, 5, and 6 months). What are the implications for public health practice? A 4-to 5-month interval between receiving the primary and booster series of CoronaVac could be an alternative to the 6-month interval in order to promote vaccine-induced immunity in elderly individuals. The findings support the optimization of booster immunization strategies. © 2023, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. All rights reserved.","",""

While these vaccines are highly efficacious against COVID-19 disease, their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection of upper respiratory tract and transmission is at best temporary. Development of safe and efficacious vaccines that are able to induce robust mucosal and systemic immune responses are needed to control new variants. In this study, we have used our nanoemulsion adjuvant (NE01) to intranasally (IN) deliver stabilized spike protein (S-2P) to induce immunogenicity in mouse and hamster models. Data presented demonstrate the induction of robust immunity in mice resulting in 100% seroconversion and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in a hamster challenge model. There was a significant induction of mucosal immune responses as demonstrated by IgA- and IgG-producing memory B cells in the lungs of animals that received intranasal immunizations compared to an alum adjuvanted intramuscular vaccine. The efficacy of the S-2P/NE01 vaccine was also demonstrated in an intranasal hamster challenge model with SARS-CoV-2 and conferred significant protection against weight loss, lung pathology, and viral clearance from both upper and lower respiratory tract. Our findings demonstrate that intranasal NE01-adjuvanted vaccine promotes protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease through activation of three arms of immune system: humoral, cellular, and mucosal, suggesting that an intranasal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may play a role in addressing a unique public health problem and unmet medical need. © 2022 Ganesan et al.

A recent analysis of immune responses in people who received inactivated vaccines has revealed that individuals with no prior infection have limited resistance to Omicron and its sub-lineages, while those with previous infections exhibit a significant amount of neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells. However, specific T-cell responses remain largely unaffected by the mutations, indicating that T-cell-mediated cellular immunity can still provide protection. Moreover, the administration of a third dose of vaccine has resulted in a marked increase in the spectrum and duration of neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells in vivo, which has enhanced resistance to emerging variants such as BA.2.75 and BA.2.12.1. These results highlight the need to consider booster immunization for previously infected individuals and the development of novel vaccination strategies. The rapid spread of adapted variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus presents a significant challenge to global health. The findings from this study underscore the importance of tailoring vaccination strategies based on individual immune backgrounds and the potential need for booster shots to combat emerging variants. Continued research and development are crucial to discovering new immunization strategies that will effectively protect public health against the evolving virus. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Antibodies, Neutralizing; B-Lymphocytes; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; coronavac; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; neutralizing antibody; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; affinity chromatography; animal cell; antibody response; antibody titer; Article; B lymphocyte; cellular immunity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytopathogenic effect; drug safety; drug tolerability; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; fatigue; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; indirect ELISA; injection site pain; male; memory B lymphocyte; middle aged; multicenter study; nonhuman; open study; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; protein expression; protein purification; SARS-CoV-2 Beta; SARS-CoV-2 Centaurus; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Gamma; SARS-CoV-2 lineage BA.2.12.1; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T lymphocyte; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; variant of concern; Vero cell line; virus isolation; virus neutralization test; B lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; genetics"

The 2022 outbreak of mpox amid COVID-19 presents an intricate situation and requires strategies to combat the status quo. Some of the challenges to controlling an epidemic include present knowledge of the disease, available treatment options, appropriate health infrastructures facilities, current scientific methods, operations concepts, availability of technical staff, financial funds, and lastly international policies to control an epidemic state. These insufficiencies often hinder the control of disease spread and jeopardize the health of countless people. Also, disease outbreaks often put a huge burden on the developing economies. These countries are the worst affected and are immensely dependent on assistance provided from the larger economies to control such outbreaks. The first case of mpox was reported in the 1970s and several outbreaks were detected thereafter in the endemic areas eventually leading to the recent outbreak. Approximately, more than 80,000 individuals were infected, and 110 countries were affected by this outbreak. Yet, no definite vaccines and drugs are available to date. The lack of human clinical trials affected thousands of individuals in availing definite disease management.

We explored 5 vaccination optimization scenarios using 2 contact matrices, assuming that 1 million persons could be vaccinated in either 3 or 6 months. We assessed these vaccine optimization strategies for the initial strain, followed by a sensitivity analysis for the Delta variant. We found that vaccinating persons <25 years of age was associated with the lowest cumulative infections for the main matrix, for both the initial strain and the Delta variant. Prioritizing the elderly (≥65 years of age) was associated with the lowest cumulative deaths for both strains in all scenarios. The consensus between the findings of both contact matrices depended on the vaccine rollout period and the objective of the vaccination program. © 2023 Authors.

However, the scale of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination campaign is unprecedented. Mass vaccination sites consolidate resources and experience into a single entity and are essential to achieving community (herd) immunity rapidly, efficiently, and equitably. Health care systems, local and regional public health entities, emergency medical services, and private organizations can rapidly come together to solve problems and achieve success. As medical directors at several mass vaccination sites across the United States, we describe key mass vaccination site concepts, including site selection, operational models, patient flow, inventory management, staffing, technology, reporting, medical oversight, communication, and equity. Lessons learned from experience operating a diverse group of mass vaccination sites will help inform not only sites operating during the current pandemic, but also may serve as a blueprint for future outbreaks of highly infectious communicable disease.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Community-based serological surveillance is an important tool to augment understanding of population-level immunity achieved through vaccine coverage and/or derived from prior infection. Methods and analysis This national population-representative serosurvey will take a three-stage cluster sample and aims to include 5600 individuals above 1 year of age. Serum samples will be collected by phlebotomy and analysed for measles IgG, rubella IgG, SARS-CoV-2 antispike protein IgG, hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core antigen using commercially available chemiluminescent immunoassays or ELISA. In addition to crude prevalence estimates and to account for differences in Timor-Leste's age structure, stratified age-standardised prevalence estimates will be calculated, using Asia in 2013 as the standard population. Additionally, this survey will derive a national asset of serum and dried blood spot samples which can be used for further investigation of infectious disease seroepidemiology and/or validation of existing and novel serological assays for infectious diseases. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Research Ethics and Technical Committee of the Instituto Nacional da Saúde, Timor-Leste and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research, Australia. Co-designing this study with Timor-Leste's Ministry-of-Health and other relevant partner organisations will allow immediate translation of findings into public health policy, which may include changes to routine immunisation service delivery and/or plans for supplementary immunisation activities.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

The re-emergence of infectious diseases may happen due to the direct impact of the pandemic on the community because of decreased access to health and medical services, interrupted transport systems, weaknesses in the supply chain, flight restrictions, closings of the border, and international trade problems. The most prevalent cause (60.9%) for low vaccine uptake and coverage during the current pandemic was fear of exposure to the COVID-19 virus outside the home. The expectation and hope that the pattern of reduction in transmission and number of influenza cases will continue over the next flu season depend on continued adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions and their long-term application. But there is always the fear and threat of increasing the spread of influenza by reducing the movement restrictions and low adherence to protective health measures due to vaccination. So far, not much information has been published about the interaction between different infectious diseases in the background of the coronavirus pandemic and related interventions. The purpose of this article is to examine the general effects of the COVID-19 vaccination on the spread of influenza in the coming seasons. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.","COVID-19; flu season; influenza; mass vaccination; NPIs; public health; public health measures; risk compensation","Child; Commerce; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Internationality; Mass Vaccination; Public Health; Seasons; Vaccination; influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; hand washing; human; immunity; mass gathering; mass immunization; pregnancy; prevalence; public health; seasonal influenza; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; virus transmission; child; commercial phenomena; influenza; international cooperation; mass immunization; prevention and control; public health; season"

Methods: Individuals previously inoculated with 2 doses of CoronaVac (N = 523) were recruited in the context of the REFUERZO clinical trial (NCT04992182) and received either placebo (N = 129), or a booster dose of CoronaVac (N = 134), BNT162b2 (N = 133), or ChAdOx1 (N = 127). Pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres (pVNT) were determined at baseline (day 0) as well as at days 14, 30, 60, and 90 after booster dose administration. Results: Inoculating a booster dose increases the pVNTs titres at days 14 and 30 in all groups, (13.5- and 12.0-fold increase for the CoronaVac group; 247.0- and 212.3-fold increase for the BTN162b2 group; and 89.1- and 128.1-fold increase for ChAdOx1 at each time point, respectively) with a decline observed at days 60 and 90. However, although pVNTs remained significantly higher for the BTN162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups at days 60 and 90, NAb titres reached baseline levels in the CoronaVac group at 90 days after inoculation. Discussion: A single heterologous booster (BTN162b2 or ChAdOx1) in individuals who completed the CoronaVac primary series resulted in an important increase in NAb titres remaining significantly higher at least for 90 days. These data may directly impact middle- and low-income countries currently using CoronaVac as the main vaccination strategy. © 2022 The Author(s)","Boosters; CoronaVac; COVID-19; Immunization programme; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination","Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; BNT162 Vaccine; Chile; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines; bnt 162b 2; coronavac; neutralizing antibody; placebo; tozinameran; vaxzevria; coronavac; neutralizing antibody; vaccine; virus antibody; adult; Article; Bayes theorem; Chile; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; double blind procedure; female; follow up; human; humoral immunity; ID50; information dissemination; male; Markov chain Monte Carlo method; multicenter study; normal human; phase 3 clinical trial; preventive health service; public health; randomized controlled trial; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; prevention and control"

Progress will depend on future advances in prophylactic vaccine activity, including advancement of candidates capable of generating more potent induction of cross-reactive T cells and durable cross-reactive antibody responses. Here we evaluated an Amphiphile (AMP) adjuvant, AMP-CpG, admixed with SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) immunogen, as a lymph node-targeted protein subunit vaccine (ELI-005) in mice and non-human primates (NHPs). AMP-mediated targeting of CpG DNA to draining lymph nodes resulted in comprehensive local immune activation characterized by extensive transcriptional reprogramming, inflammatory proteomic milieu, and activation of innate immune cells as key orchestrators of antigen-directed adaptive immunity. Prime-boost immunization with AMP-CpG in mice induced potent and durable T cell responses in multiple anatomical sites critical for prophylactic efficacy and prevention of severe disease. Long-lived memory responses were rapidly expanded upon re-exposure to antigen. In parallel, RBD-specific antibodies were long-lived, and exhibited cross-reactive recognition of variant RBD. AMP-CpG-adjuvanted prime-boost immunization in NHPs was safe and well tolerated, while promoting multi-cytokine-producing circulating T cell responses cross-reactive across variants of concern (VOC). Expansion of RBD-specific germinal center (GC) B cells in lymph nodes correlated to rapid seroconversion with variant-specific neutralizing antibody responses exceeding those measured in convalescent human plasma. These results demonstrate the promise of lymph-node adjuvant-targeting to coordinate innate immunity and generate robust adaptive responses critical for vaccine efficacy. © 2022, The Author(s).","","adjuvant; agatolimod; amphophile; convalescent plasma; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; eli 005; gamma interferon; myeloid differentiation factor 88; neutralizing antibody; sars cov 2 spike receptor binding domain protein; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; STAT3 protein; subunit vaccine; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 9; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; adaptive immunity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; antigen recognition; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell expansion; cellular immunity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; cytokine production; draining lymph node; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug safety; drug stability; drug tolerability; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; genetic transcription; germinal center; humoral immunity; immunization; immunocompetent cell; immunogenicity; immunomodulation; infection prevention; innate immunity; male; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; proteomics; SARS-CoV-2 (clinical isolate Wuhan/Hu-1/2019); seroconversion; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; treatment duration; vaccination; vaccine development; virus neutralization"

However, some developing countries are still a long way from achieving herd immunity through vaccination. In some territories, such as the Colombian Amazon, mass immunization strategies have been implemented with the CoronaVac® vaccine. Due to its proximity to Brazil, where one of the variants of interest of SARS-CoV-2 circulates. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of the CoronaVac® vaccine in a population of the Colombian Amazon. Methods: Between February 24, 2021, and August 10, 2021, a descriptive observational study was carried out in which a population of individuals over 18 years of age immunized with two doses of the CoronaVac® vaccine was evaluated. The study site was in the municipality of Mitú, Vaupés, in southeastern Colombia, a region located in the Amazon bordering Brazil. Results. 99% of the urban population of the Mitú municipality were vaccinated with CoronaVac®. To date, 5.7% of vaccinated individuals have become ill, and only 0.1% of these require hospitalization. One death was attributable to COVID-19 has been reported among vaccinated individuals, and the vaccine has shown 94.3% effectiveness against mild disease and 99.9% against severe infection. Conclusions: The herd immunity achieved through mass vaccination in this population has made it possible to reduce the rate of complicated cases and mortality from COVID-19 in this region of the Colombian Amazon. Highlights: CoronaVac® has shown 94.3% effectiveness against mild disease and 99.9% against severe infection in this indigenous population.CoronaVac® reduces the mortality rate from 2.2% in 2020 to 0.22% in 2021.The herd immunity was achieved through mass vaccination in this region of the Colombian Amazon. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19 vaccines; Mass vaccination; Post-exposure; Prevention; Prophylaxis; Public health","coronavac; adult; Article; Brazil; clinical evaluation; Colombia; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; disease severity; drug efficacy; female; herd immunity; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; vaccination"

In our analysis, we focus on adolescents’ impressions towards anti-vaxxer behavior. The aim of the study is to figure out students’ opinions about vaccine reluctance, connecting possible explanations that motivate anti-vaxxer decisions with common specific personality traits. We further investigate people’s forecasts concerning the evolution of the pandemic. Between 2021 and 2022, we conducted a randomized survey experiment on a sample of high school individuals ((Formula presented.)) living in different Italian regions. At that time, the vaccination campaign had already been promoted for nearly one year. From the analysis, it emerges that vaccinated people (92%), especially males, tend to be more pessimistic and attribute a higher level of generic distrust in science to anti-vaxxers. The results show that family background (mother’s education) represents the most influential regressor: individuals coming from less educated families are less prone to attribute generic distrust and distrust of vaccines as principal reasons for vaccine reluctance. Similarly, those who rarely use social media develop a minor tendency to believe in a generic pessimism of anti-vaxxers. However, concerning the future of the pandemic, they are less likely to be optimistic toward vaccines. Overall, our findings shed light on adolescents’ perceptions regarding the factors that influence vaccine hesitancy and highlight the need for targeted communication strategies to improve vaccination rates. © 2023 by the authors.","adolescents; COVID-19; ethics; pandemic preparedness; trust; vaccine hesitancy","adolescent; adult; anti-vaccination movement; Article; child; coronavirus disease 2019; disaster preparedness; distrust; drug uptake; education; ethics; female; herd immunity; human; human experiment; immunization; Italian (citizen); male; pandemic; pessimism; principal component analysis; public opinion; social media; trust; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; young adult"

World leaders have accelerated vaccine development, approval, production and distribution as a pragmatic approach to addressing the immediate public health challenges of the first two and a half years of the pandemic. Main body: The currently predominant, highly transmissible Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has brought us closer to the threshold required to achieve herd immunity by greatly increasing rates of natural infection. Paradoxically, in parallel with rising vaccination levels in industrialized nations, this indirectly reduces the need for mass vaccine campaigns. Principal concerns that contribute to low vaccination rates which persist in several other countries, particularly of the Global South, are vaccine hesitancy and unequal access to vaccination. Social uncertainty fueled by fake news, misinformation, unfounded lay opinions and conspiracy theories has inevitably led to an erosion of public trust in vaccination. Conclusion: To address the current mismatch between supply and demand of COVID-19 vaccines, there should be a focus on three principles: decelerating vaccine production, increasing distribution across communities, and optimizing cost-effectiveness of distribution logistics. Slowing down and switching from large-scale production to effectively ‘made to order’ is a feasible option, which should be commensurate with management capacity. Transparent and evidence-based data should be widely and freely disseminated to the public through multimedia channels to mitigate miscommunication and conspiracy theories. Use of soon-to-expire stockpiles should be prioritized not only to enhance booster dose rollouts in adults but to expand immunization campaigns to children (especially those aged 5–11 years), subject to national approval. Future research should ideally aim to develop vaccines that only require basic, affordable storage and maintenance procedures as opposed to sophisticated and expensive protocols.

Solid organ transplant recipients have a reduced humoral immune response to DNA and RNA vaccines compared to the immunocompetent counterpart, thus remaining at high risk for COVID-19. Vaccines are considered safe for all SOTRs, but there are in literature some reports of problems due to the vaccination in these patients such as episode of steroid-resistant acute cellular rejection and two cases of endothelial corneal allograft rejection following immunization.

COVID-19 vaccines protect the public and limit viral spread. However, public acceptance is significantly dependent on the efficacy and side effects (SEs) of the vaccinations being produced. Four important mechanisms have been examined for COVID-19 vaccines: DNA-based, mRNA-based, protein-based, and inactivated viruses. Vaccination safety research was formerly limited to manufacturer-sponsored studies, but numerous additional cross-sectional survey-based studies conducted globally have contributed to the generation of vaccine-related safety data reports. Twenty-seven studies and twenty-four case reports published-up till 2021 were overviewed for the presentation of SEs and their severity. Injection site pain remained the most dominant localized SE, while headache and fatigue were the most prevalent systemic SEs. Most studies reported that all vaccinations were safe, with very little or no adverse effects, but the nature of SEs was reported to be more persistent in DNA-and mRNA-based vaccines, while inactivated viral vaccines were associated with longer-duration SEs. Overall, SEs were found to be more dominant in women and youngsters. Case reports of adverse reactions have also been documented, but there is still a need to find out their pathological linkage with the COVID-19 vaccination. © 2022 by the authors.

It is more commonly known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); the pandemic threat continues to spread aroundthe world with the fluctuating emergence of its new variants. The severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to serious acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has led to a high human mortality rate and disruption of socioeconomic well-being. For the restoration of pre-pandemic normalcy, the international scientific community has been conducting research on a war footing to limit extremely pathogenic COVID-19 through diagnosis, treatment, and immunization. Since the first report of COVID-19 viral infection, an array of laboratory-based and point-of-care (POC) approaches have emerged for diagnosing and understanding its status of outbreak. The RT-PCR-based viral nucleic acid test (NAT) is one of the rapidly developed and most used COVID-19 detection approaches. Notably, the current forbidding status of COVID-19 requires the development of safe, targeted vaccines/vaccine injections (shots) that can reduce its associated morbidity and mortality. Massive and accelerated vaccination campaigns would be the most effective and ultimate hope to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak, emerging biotechnologies and their multidisciplinary approaches have accelerated the understanding of molecular details as well as the development of a wide range of diagnostics and potential vaccine candidates, which are indispensable to combating the highly contagious COVID-19. Several vaccine candidates have completed phase III clinical studies and are reported to be effective in immunizing against COVID-19 after their rollout via emergency use authorization (EUA). However, optimizing the type of vaccine candidates and its route of delivery that works best to control viral spread is crucial to face the threatening variants expected to emerge over time. In conclusion, the insights of this review would facilitate the development of more likely diagnostics and ideal vaccines for the global control of COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.

While these policies have prompted ethical, scientific, practical, legal and political debate, there has been limited evaluation of their potential unintended consequences. Here, we outline a comprehensive set of hypotheses for why these policies may ultimately be counterproductive and harmful. Our framework considers four domains: (1) behavioural psychology, (2) politics and law, (3) socioeconomics, and (4) the integrity of science and public health. While current vaccines appear to have had a significant impact on decreasing COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality burdens, we argue that current mandatory vaccine policies are scientifically questionable and are likely to cause more societal harm than good. Restricting people's access to work, education, public transport and social life based on COVID-19 vaccination status impinges on human rights, promotes stigma and social polarisation, and adversely affects health and well-being. Current policies may lead to a widening of health and economic inequalities, detrimental long-term impacts on trust in government and scientific institutions, and reduce the uptake of future public health measures, including COVID-19 vaccines as well as routine immunisations. Mandating vaccination is one of the most powerful interventions in public health and should be used sparingly and carefully to uphold ethical norms and trust in institutions. We argue that current COVID-19 vaccine policies should be re-evaluated in light of the negative consequences that we outline. Leveraging empowering strategies based on trust and public consultation, and improving healthcare services and infrastructure, represent a more sustainable approach to optimising COVID-19 vaccination programmes and, more broadly, the health and well-being of the public.  © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

Vaccination of the world base population is considered the most promising and challenging approach to achieving herd immunity. As healthcare organizations took on the extensive task of vaccinating the entire U.S. population, digital health companies expanded their automated health platforms in order to help ease the administrative burdens of mass inoculation. Although some software companies offer free applications to large organizations, there are prohibitive costs for small clinics such as the Good Health Associates Clinic (GHAC) for integrating and implementing new self-scheduling software into our e-Clinical Works (ECW) Electronic Health Record (EHR). These cost burdens resulted in a search that extended beyond existing technology, and in investing in new solutions to make it easier, more efficient, more cost-effective, and more scalable. Objective: In comparison to commercial entities, primary care clinics (PCCs) have the advantage of engaging the population for vaccination through personalized continuity of clinical care due to good rapport between their patients and the PCC team. In order to support the overall national campaign to prevent COVID-19 infections and restore public health, the GHAC wanted to make COVID-19 vaccination accessible to its patients and to the communities it serves. We aimed to achieve a coordinated COVID-19 vaccination drive in our community through our small primary care clinic by developing and using an easily implementable, cost-effective self-registration and scheduling web-based mobile platform, using the principle of “C.D.S. Five Rights”. Results: Overall, the Moderna vaccination drive using our developed self-registration and scheduling web portal and SMS messaging mobile platform improved vaccination uptake (51%) compared to overall vaccination uptake in our town, county (36%), and state (39%) during April–July 2021. Conclusions: Based on our experience during this COVID-19 vaccination drive, we conclude that PCCs have significant leverage as “invaluable warriors”, along with government and media education available, to engage patients for vaccination uptake; this leads to national preventive health spread in our population, and reduces expenses related to acute illness and hospitalization. In terms of cost-effectiveness, small PCCs are worthy of government-sponsored funding and incentives, including mandating EHR vendors to provide free (or minimal fee) software for patient self-registration and scheduling, in order to improve vaccination drive access. Hence, improved access to personalized informative continuity of clinical care in the PCC setting is a “critical link” in accelerating similar cost-effective campaigns in patient vaccine uptake. © 2022 by the authors.

The utilization of mRNA vaccines in the context of infectious disease has no precedent. The many alterations in the vaccine mRNA hide the mRNA from cellular defenses and promote a longer biological half-life and high production of spike protein. However, the immune response to the vaccine is very different from that to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this paper, we present evidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health. Immune cells that have taken up the vaccine nanoparticles release into circulation large numbers of exosomes containing spike protein along with critical microRNAs that induce a signaling response in recipient cells at distant sites. We also identify potential profound disturbances in regulatory control of protein synthesis and cancer surveillance. These disturbances potentially have a causal link to neurodegenerative disease, myocarditis, immune thrombocytopenia, Bell's palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response and tumorigenesis. We show evidence from the VAERS database supporting our hypothesis. We believe a comprehensive risk/benefit assessment of the mRNA vaccines questions them as positive contributors to public health. © 2022 The Authors","Cancer; Exosomes; G-quadruplexes; microRNAs; SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines; Type I interferon Response","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Exosomes; G-Quadruplexes; Humans; Immunity, Innate; MicroRNAs; Neurodegenerative Diseases; RNA, Messenger; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vaccination; alpha interferon; alpha2b interferon; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta interferon; bnt 162b 2; dexamethasone; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; elasomeran; guanine quadruplex; hepatitis A vaccine; influenza vaccine; interferon; measles mumps rubella vaccine; microRNA; oral poliomyelitis vaccine; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; recombinant alpha interferon; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; steroid; sulfatide; tozinameran; vaccine; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; messenger RNA; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; acute liver failure; acute myeloid leukemia; adaptive immunity; Alzheimer disease; anosmia; arm weakness; artery thrombosis; Article; autoimmune thrombocytopenia; Bell palsy; bladder cancer; bradycardia; brain tumor; breast cancer; carcinoma; cerebral sinus thrombosis; cognitive defect; colon cancer; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine response; deep vein thrombosis; degenerative disease; demyelinating disease; DNA methylation; DNA repair; drug effect; drug fatality; drug response; dysphagia; dysphonia; dyspnea; exosome; facial nerve paralysis; faintness; giant cell arteritis; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; hearing impairment; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart infarction; hepatitis C; herpes simplex; herpes zoster; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; immune deficiency; immunocompetent cell; immunosurveillance; innate immunity; jaundice; leukemia; limbic encephalitis; limited mobility; liver abscess; liver cancer; liver cirrhosis; liver cyst; liver disease; liver dysfunction; liver failure; liver function test; liver hemangioma; liver injury; liver transplantation; lung cancer; lung embolism; lymphoma; malignant neoplasm; memory disorder; mesenteric vein thrombosis; metastasis; migraine; myasthenia; myocarditis; myositis; nausea; neoplasm; nervous system inflammation; neurologic disease; nonhuman; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; optic nerve disease; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; paresthesia; parkinsonism; pericarditis; peripheral neuropathy; pharmacovigilance; portal vein thrombosis; prostate cancer; protein synthesis regulation; pulmonary thrombosis; risk benefit analysis; RNA immunization; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; side effect; skin manifestation; superficial thrombophlebitis; thrombosis; tinnitus; toxic hepatitis; tumor immunity; type I interferon signaling; uterus cancer; vaccine immunogenicity; Varicella zoster virus; vein thrombosis; vertigo; virus reactivation; vomiting; adverse event; degenerative disease; genetics; innate immunity; metabolism; prevention and control; vaccination"

High hospitalization numbers due to the Omicron variant has retriggered precautionary restrictions and border closures even in countries which have attained herd immunity by mass vaccinations. Surveillance systems for accurate screening of the Omicron variant are needed to guide implementation of hygiene principles and restrictions. Development of vaccines against the variants is important as the pandemic evolves. Whether Omicron is the last variant depends on the success of the local and global public-health strategies against SARS-CoV-2. © 2022 Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)","Delta variant; Mutations; Omicron variant; SARS-CoV-2; South Africa; Vaccine; Variant of concern","COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Article; Betacoronavirus; disease surveillance; epidemic; herd immunity; hospitalization; human; hygiene; mass immunization; nonhuman; pandemic; point mutation; public health; public health surveillance; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; screening test; sequence analysis; South Africa; vaccine development; variant of concern; virus cell interaction; epidemiology; genetics"

Methods: We prospectively studied socioeconomic, biologic, and clinical factors affecting humoral immunity in 87 unvaccinated pregnant women hospitalized in Buenos Aires for symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Results: The number of days between symptom onset and childbirth predicted maternal and newborn virus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG). These findings suggest newborns may benefit less when mothers deliver soon after COVID-19 infection. Similarly, a longer time between symptom onset and birth predicted higher in utero transfer of maternal IgG and its concentration in cord blood. Older gestational age at birth was associated with lower maternal to cord blood IgG ratio. Of women with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 87% developed RBD-specific IgA responses in breast milk within 96 hours of childbirth. IgA was not significantly associated with time from infection but correlated with maternal serum IgG and placental transfer. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the combined role of biologic, clinical, and socioeconomic variables associated with maternal RBD-specific antibodies and supports early vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in socioeconomically vulnerable pregnant women.

This study aimed to estimate the pooled proportion of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose uptake and intention to get the booster dose among general populations and healthcare workers (HCWs). We searched PsycINFO, Scopus, EBSCO, MEDLINE Central/PubMed, ProQuest, SciELO, SAGE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect according to PRISMA guidelines. From a total of 1079 screened records, 50 studies were extracted. Meta-analysis was conducted using 48 high-quality studies according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale quality assessment tool. Using the 48 included studies, the pooled proportion of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance among 198,831 subjects was 81% (95% confidence interval (CI): 75–85%, I2 = 100%). The actual uptake of the booster dose in eight studies involving 12,995 subjects was 31% (95% CI: 19–46%, I2 = 100%), while the intention to have the booster dose of the vaccine was 79% (95% CI: 72–85%, I2 = 100%). The acceptance of the booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines among HCWs was 66% (95% CI: 58–74%), I2 = 99%). Meta-regression revealed that previous COVID-19 infection was associated with a lower intention to have the booster dose. Conversely, previous COVID-19 infection was associated with a significantly higher level of booster dose actual uptake. The pooled booster dose acceptance in the WHO region of the Americas, which did not include any actual vaccination, was 77% (95% CI: 66–85%, I2 = 100%). The pooled acceptance of the booster dose in the Western Pacific was 89% (95% CI: 84–92%, I2 = 100), followed by the European region: 86% (95% CI: 81–90%, I2 = 99%), the Eastern Mediterranean region: 59% (95% CI: 46–71%, I2 = 99%), and the Southeast Asian region: 52% (95% CI: 43–61%, I2 = 95). Having chronic disease and trust in the vaccine effectiveness were the significant predictors of booster dose COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The global acceptance rate of COVID-19 booster vaccine is high, but the rates vary by region. To achieve herd immunity for the disease, a high level of vaccination acceptance is required. Intensive vaccination campaigns and programs are still needed around the world to raise public awareness regarding the importance of accepting COVID-19 vaccines needed for proper control of the pandemic. © 2022 by the authors.","communicable disease control; public health practice; secondary immunization; vaccine attitude; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine preference; vaccine rejection; vaccine resistance","ad5 ncov; coronavac; covilo; elasomeran; ibacovavec; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; sputnik v vaccine; tozinameran; vaxzevria; adult; aged; child; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug safety; European; female; health care personnel; human; male; meta analysis; middle aged; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; patient attitude; population; preschool child; Review; Southeast Asian; Southern Europe; systematic review; trust; vaccination; vaccination reaction; vaccine acceptance; vaccine hesitancy; vaccinee; Western Hemisphere; World Health Organization; young adult"

Anxiety about vaccines and vaccination programs leading to vaccine hesitancy results from a complex mix of social and political influences, cultural and religious beliefs, the availability of and ability to interpret health and scientific information, and personal and population experiences of health systems and government policies. Vaccine hesitancy is becoming a serious threat to vaccination programs, and was identified as one of the World Health Organization’s top ten global health threats in 2019. The negative impact of anti-vaccination movements is frequently cited as one of the major reasons for rising vaccine hesitancy amongst the general public world-wide. This review discusses the various issues surrounding vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement, starting with the definitions of vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement in their early history and in the modern era, before discussing the key drivers of vaccine hesitancy, particularly across different regions of the world, with a focus on various countries with low-, middle-, or high-income economies with different socio-economic populations. The review concludes with the impact of vaccine hesitancy on herd immunity and social, psychological, and public health measures to counter vaccine hesitancy. © 2022 by the authors.","anti-vaccine movement; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; vaccines","diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; Human papilloma virus vaccine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; Mycobacterium vaccine; poliomyelitis vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; smallpox vaccine; swine influenza vaccine; thiomersal; anti-vaccination movement; anxiety; autism; behavior change; bulbar poliomyelitis; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia; cowpox; decision making; Guillain Barre syndrome; health care personnel; health care policy; high income country; human; immune response; immunization; influenza; measles; mumps; pertussis; pneumonia; prevalence; psychologic assessment; public health; Review; Rotavirus; rubella; Simian virus 40; smallpox; social media; socioeconomics; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine preventable disease; World Health Organization"

Early evidence indicated that the variant was more transmissible and less severe than previous variants. As the virus was expected to spread quickly through the population of England, it was important that some understanding of the immunological landscape of the country was developed. This paper attempts to estimate the number of people with good immunity to the Omicron variant, defined as either recent infection with two doses of vaccine, or two doses of vaccine with a recent booster dose. To achieve this, we use a process of iterative proportional fitting to estimate the cell values of a contingency table, using national immunisation records and real-time model infection estimates as marginal values. Our results indicate that, despite the increased risk of immune evasion with the Omicron variant, a high proportion of England’s population had good immunity to the virus, particularly in older age groups. However, low rates of immunity in younger populations may allow endemic infection to persist for some time. © 2022 Shingleton et al.

Although initial data did not demonstrate pregnancy as a more susceptible period to severe outcomes of acute severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are an increasing number of reports showing that not only pregnant women might be at significantly higher risk than non-pregnant women by COVID-19 but also the fetus. These findings may be related to adaptive changes that occur during pregnancy, such as the reduction in the residual respiratory capacity, the decrease in viral immune responses, and the increased risk for thromboembolic events. Additionally, despite the SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission evidence being uncommon, maternal illness severity might reflect serious perinatal and neonatal outcomes. Thus, protecting the maternal–fetal dyad against COVID-19 is critical. Even though pregnant women initially were excluded from vaccine trials, several studies have provided safety and efficacy of the overall vaccine COVID-19 platforms. Vaccination during pregnancy becomes a priority and can generate benefits for both the mother and newborn: maternal neutralizing antibodies are transmitted through the placenta and breastfeeding. Moreover, regarding passive immunization, human milk contains other bioactive molecules and cells able to modulate the newborn’s immune response, which can be amplified after the vaccine. Nonetheless, many issues remain to be elucidated, considering the magnitude of the protective immunity transferred, the duration of the induced immunity, and the optimal interval for pregnant immunization. In this review, we assessed these unmet topics supported by literature evidence regarding the vaccine’s immunogenicity, pregnancy immune heterogeneity, and the unique human milk antiviral features.

We aimed to generate robust information on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in this region since the beginning of the pandemic and throughout 2022. Methods: For each of the 47 countries of the WHO African region, we consolidated COVID-19 data from reported infections and deaths (from WHO statistics); published literature on socioecological, biophysical, and public health interventions; and immunity status and variants of concern, to build a dynamic and comprehensive picture of COVID-19 burden. The model is consolidated through a partially observed Markov decision process, with a Fourier series to produce observed patterns over time based on the SEIRD (denoting susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and dead) modelling framework. The model was set up to run weekly, by country, from the date the first infection was reported in each country until Dec 31, 2021. New variants were introduced into the model based on sequenced data reported by countries. The models were then extrapolated until the end of 2022 and included three scenarios based on possible new variants with varying transmissibility, severity, or immunogenicity. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, our model estimates the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the African region to be 505·6 million (95% CI 476·0–536·2), inferring that only 1·4% (one in 71) of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the region were reported. Deaths are estimated at 439 500 (95% CI 344 374–574 785), with 35·3% (one in three) of these reported as COVID-19-related deaths. Although the number of infections were similar between 2020 and 2021, 81% of the deaths were in 2021. 52·3% (95% CI 43·5–95·2) of the region's population is estimated to have some SARS-CoV-2 immunity, given vaccination coverage of 14·7% as of Dec 31, 2021. By the end of 2022, we estimate that infections will remain high, at around 166·2 million (95% CI 157·5–174·9) infections, but deaths will substantially reduce to 22 563 (14 970–38 831). Interpretation: The African region is estimated to have had a similar number of COVID-19 infections to that of the rest of the world, but with fewer deaths. Our model suggests that the current approach to SARS-CoV-2 testing is missing most infections. These results are consistent with findings from representative seroprevalence studies. There is, therefore, a need for surveillance of hospitalisations, comorbidities, and the emergence of new variants of concern, and scale-up of representative seroprevalence studies, as core response strategies.

In this regard, the so-called variants of concern (VOCs) feature mutations that confer increased transmissibility and evasion of antibody responses. The VOCs have caused significant spikes in COVID-19 cases, raising significant concerns about whether COVID-19 vaccines will protect against current and future variants. In this context, whereas the protection COVID-19 vaccines offer against the acquisition of infection appears compromised, the protection against severe COVID-19 is maintained. From an immunologic standpoint, this is likely underpinned by the maintenance of T-cell responses against VOCs. Therefore, the role of T-cells is essential to understanding the broader adaptive immune response to COVID-19, which has the potential to shape public policies on vaccine protocols and inform future vaccine design.

Both campaigns were implemented during ongoing COVID-19 transmission. By April, 220 measles cases and two deaths were confirmed from eight districts of Nepal. The NIP triangulated information from surveillance (measles and COVID-19), measles immunization performance and immunity profile, programme capacities and community engagement and applied a logical decision-making framework to the collated data to inform ‘Go/No-Go’ decisions for ORI interventions. This was reviewed by the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) for endorsement. Outbreak response with non-selective immunization (ORI), vitamin-A administration and case management were implemented in affected municipalities of four districts, while in the remaining districts outbreak response without ORI were undertaken. The structure and iterative application of this logical framework has been described. ORI was implemented without interrupting the ongoing measles-rubella vaccination campaign which had targeted children from 9 to 59 months of age. The age group for ORI was same as SIA in one sub-district area, while for the other three sub-district areas it was from 6 months to 15 years of age. More than 32,000 persons (97% coverage) were vaccinated in ORI response. Overall measles incidence decreased by 98% after ORI. The daily incidence rate of measles was 94 times higher (95% confidence interval: 36.11 – 347.62) before the ORI compared to two weeks after ORI until year end. Close attention to surveillance and other data to inform actions and seamless collaboration between NIP and core immunization partners (WHO, UNICEF), with guidance from NIAC were key elements in successful implementation. This was an example of feasible application of the global framework for implementation of a mass vaccination campaign during COVID-19 through application of a simple decision-making logical framework. © 2022","COVID-19; Immunization; Measles; Nepal; NITAG; Outbreak response","Child; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Immunization; Measles; Nepal; Rubella; immunoglobulin M; oral poliomyelitis vaccine; adolescent; advisory committee; Article; case management; child; conjunctivitis; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; disease surveillance; disease transmission; fever; follow up; geographic distribution; health care delivery; health care facility; health care personnel; human; immunity; immunization; incidence; infection control; intervention study; maculopapular rash; major clinical study; mass immunization; measles; measles vaccination; pandemic; preschool child; preventive health service; public health; public health campaign; risk assessment; rubella; school child; social support; vaccination; virus transmission; epidemic; immunization; measles; Nepal; prevention and control; rubella"

We evaluated the serological response, safety, and efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine in children with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective, multicenter, case–control study was conducted in a pediatric population, including patients with IBD, aged 12–18 years. Clinical characteristics, safety profile, and serum samples for surrogate virus-neutralizing antibody testing pre- and post-BNT162b2 vaccination were assessed. The breakthrough infection rate during the Omicron outbreak was calculated to evaluate efficacy. Fifteen controls and twenty-three patients with IBD were enrolled. After two vaccine doses, the median level of percentage inhibition was highly increased, without significant differences between the groups (control 96.9 and IBD 96.3). However, it was significantly reduced in IBD patients receiving combination therapy (anti-tumor necrosis factor-α + immunomodulators) relative to those in other therapies and controls. Serious adverse events were not observed. The breakthrough infection rate was 42.1%, without statistical differences between the groups. Immunization with BNT162b2 in patients with IBD was comparable with that in healthy adolescents in terms of immunogenicity and safety. Nevertheless, the efficacy of BNT162b2 in preventing infection caused by the Omicron variant in the pediatric population was insufficient. © 2022 by the authors.","adolescent; COVID-19 breakthrough infections; COVID-19 vaccines; inflammatory bowel diseases; pediatric","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azathioprine; calgranulin; hemoglobin; immunomodulating agent; infliximab; mesalazine; messenger RNA; methotrexate; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; tumor necrosis factor; adolescent; antibody response; Article; blood sampling; breakthrough infection; case control study; cervical lymphadenopathy; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Crohn disease; disease activity; drug efficacy; drug safety; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; fatigue; fatty liver; female; fever; follow up; headache; heart murmur; hospitalization; human; humoral immunity; immunization; immunogenicity; inflammatory bowel disease; male; monotherapy; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; multicenter study; myalgia; plaque reduction neutralization test; public health; quality control; rash; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; sensitivity and specificity; thorax pain; thyroid disease; ulcerative colitis; vaccination; virus neutralization test"

Patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of disease and therapy-related effects. Available vaccines were highly effective against the original viral strains in clinical trials. However, initial vaccination efforts in this vulnerable population were impacted by federal policy that created substantial vaccine scarcity and allocation difficulties by recommending prioritization of unmanageably large patient populations including the entire elderly population and patients over the age of 16 with broadly defined, high-risk medical conditions (including cancer). We found that these overly broad recommendations led nearly two-thirds of states to elect not to give adequate vaccination priority to patients with cancer, exposing this vulnerable population to potentially preventable infection. With the virulent omicron variant spreading rapidly, there is newfound concern about waning immunity, particularly in immunocompromised populations. To address this issue, the Centers for Disease Control is recommending boosters for patients who meet age, occupational exposure, or medical criteria, in similar fashion to recommendations during the initial vaccination phase. Thus, this approach raises the question of whether state-level decisions on how to sub prioritize may inadvertently once again result in delayed immunizations for particularly vulnerable subgroups – such as patients with cancer. We discuss the implications of this public health policy on the likelihood of timely re-vaccination of patients with cancer. With the omicron variant continuing its unchecked global spread, equitable distribution of booster immunizations is critical to minimizing inherent medical and socioeconomic inequities in COVID-related morbidity and mortality. © 2022 The Author(s)","","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; advisory committee; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; coronavirus disease 2019; disease control; essential worker; health care access; health care personnel; health care quality; health equity; high risk patient; human; immunosuppressive treatment; long term care; mass immunization; nonhuman; occupational exposure; public health; revaccination; vaccine hesitancy; vulnerable population"

There is limited data on the immune response to vaccination among HCWs. We aim to determine seroprevalence rates and neutralizing IgG antibody response to various immunizations among HCWs. Methods: This study was conducted between July and September 2021, in which blood samples were obtained from HCWs and SARS-CoV-2 IgG neutralizing antibodies were measured. Data regarding vaccination status with Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm, or AstraZeneca vaccines, occu-pation, and prior COVID-19 infection were analyzed. Results: COVID-19 infection post-vaccination was associated with higher mean antibody titers, regardless of vaccine type. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination produced higher mean antibody titers for HCWs with prior COVID-19 infection (p < 0.00001) than other types of vaccines. Although 96% of HCWs were vaccinated, 3% were seronegative. For HCWs who were seropositive, there were no significant differences between the mean antibody titers when comparing occupations and blood indices. Conclusion: Awareness of the immunity status of HCWs is key to protecting this important group against SARS-CoV-2, especially those without prior COVID-19 infection. Further public health efforts regarding booster vaccination for HCWs are crucial to provide necessary antibody protection. © 2022 by the authors.

The influenza virus has frequent antigenic drifts that can facilitate escape from pre-existing population immunity and lead to the rapid spread and annual seasonal epidemics. Influenza outbreaks occur in crowded settings, such as schools, kindergartens, and nursing homes. Seasonal influenza epidemics can cause 3-5 million severe cases and 290 000-650 000 respiratory disease-related deaths worldwide every year. Pregnant women, infants, adults 60 years and older, and individuals with comorbidities or underlying medical conditions are at the highest risk of severe illness and death from influenza. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some provinces in southern China had a summer peak of influenza. SARS-CoV-2 may co-circulate with influenza and other respiratory viruses in the upcoming winter-spring influenza season. Annual influenza vaccination is an effective way to prevent influenza, reduce influenza-related severe illness and death, and reduce the harm caused by influenza-related diseases and the use of medical resources. The currently approved influenza vaccines in China include trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3), quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3). IIV3 is produced as a split virus vaccine and subunit vaccine; IIV4 is produced as a split virus vaccine; and LAIV3 is a live, attenuated virus vaccine. Except for some jurisdictions in China, the influenza vaccine is a non-immunization program vaccine-voluntarily and self-paid. China CDC has issued 'Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China' every year from 2018 to 2021. Over the past year, new research evidence has been published at home and abroad. To better guide the prevention and control of influenza and vaccination in China, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccination Technical Working Group updated and revised the 2021-2022 Technical Guidelines with the latest research progress into the 'Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China (2022-2023)'. The new version has updated five key areas: (1) new research evidence-especially research conducted in China-has been added, including new estimates of the burden of influenza disease, assessments of influenza vaccine effectiveness and safety, and analyses of the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination; (2) policies and measures for influenza prevention and control that were issued by the government over the past year; (3) influenza vaccines approved for marketing in China this year; (4) composition of trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines for the 2022-2023 northern hemisphere influenza season; and (5) recommendations for influenza vaccination during the 2022-2023 influenza season. The 2022-2023 Guidelines recommend that vaccination clinics provide influenza vaccination services to all people aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and have no contraindications to the influenza vaccine. For adults ≥ 18 years, co-administration of COVID-19 and inactivated influenza vaccines in separate arms is acceptable regarding immunogenicity and reactogenicity. For people under 18 years old, there should be at least 14 days between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination. The Guidelines express no preference for influenza vaccine type or manufacturer-any approved, age-appropriate influenza vaccines can be used. To minimize harm from influenza and limit the impact on the effort to prevent and control COVID-19 in China, the Technical Guidelines recommend priority vaccination of the following high-risk groups during the upcoming 2022-2023 influenza season: (1) healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, and quarantine professionals; (2) volunteers and staff who provide services and support for large events; (3) people living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staff who take care of vulnerable, at-risk individuals; (4) people who work in high population density settings, including teachers and students in kindergartens and primary and secondary schools, and prisoners and prison staff; and (5) people at high risk of influenza, including adults ≥ 60 years of age, children 6-59 months of age, individuals with comorbidities or underlying medical conditions, family members and caregivers of infants under 6 months of age, and pregnant women. Children 6 months to 8 years of age who receive inactivated influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses, with an inter-dose interval of 4 or more weeks. Children who previously received the influenza vaccine and anyone 9 years or older need only one dose. LAIV is recommended only for a single dose regardless of the previous influenza vaccination. Vaccination should begin as soon as influenza vaccines become available and preferably should be completed before the onset of the local influenza season. Repeated influenza vaccination during a single influenza season is not recommended. Vaccination clinics should provide immunization services throughout the epidemic season. Pregnant women can receive inactivated influenza vaccine at any stage of pregnancy.

Because of fluctuations in vaccine availability, strategies such as delayed second dose and heterologous prime-boost have been used. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in frail, older people are unknown. We aimed to assess the antigenicity of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in frail, older people in a real-world setting, with a rationed interval dosing of 16 weeks between the prime and boost doses. Methods: This prospective observational cohort study was done across 12 long-term care facilities of the Montréal Centre-Sud – Integrated University Health and Social Services Centre in Montréal, Québec, Canada. Under a rationing strategy mandated by the provincial government, adults aged 65 years and older residing in long-term care facilities in Québec, Canada, with or without previously documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, were administered homologous or heterologous mRNA vaccines, with an extended 16-week interval between doses. All older residents in participating long-term care facilities who received two vaccine doses were eligible for inclusion in this study. Participants were enrolled from Dec 31, 2020, to Feb 16, 2021, and data were collected up to June 9, 2021. Clinical data and blood samples were serially collected from participants at the following timepoints: at baseline, before the first dose; 4 weeks after the first dose; 6–10 weeks after the first dose; 16 weeks after the first dose, up to 2 days before administration of the second dose; and 4 weeks after the second dose. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (to the trimeric spike protein, the receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein) by automated chemiluminescent ELISA. Two cohorts were used in this study: a discovery cohort, for which blood samples were collected before administration of the first vaccine dose and longitudinally thereafter; and a confirmatory cohort, for which blood samples were only collected from 4 weeks after the prime dose. Analyses were done in the discovery cohort, with validation in the confirmatory cohort, when applicable. Findings: The total study sample consisted of 185 participants. 65 participants received two doses of mRNA-1273 (Spikevax; Moderna), 36 received two doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty; Pfizer–BioNTech), and 84 received mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2. In the discovery cohort, after a significant increase in anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations 4 weeks after the prime dose (from 4·86 log binding antibody units [BAU]/mL to 8·53 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and from 5·21 log BAU/mL to 8·05 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG), there was a significant decline in anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations until the boost dose (7·10 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 7·60 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG), followed by an increase 4 weeks later for both vaccines (9·58 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 9·23 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG). SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals showed lower antibody responses than previously infected individuals at all timepoints tested up to 16 weeks after the prime dose, but achieved similar antibody responses to previously infected participants by 4 weeks after the second dose. Individuals primed with the BNT162b2 vaccine showed a larger decrease in mean anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations with a 16-week interval between doses (from 8·12 log BAU/mL to 4·25 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG responses and from 8·18 log BAU/mL to 6·66 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG responses) than did those who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (two doses of mRNA-1273: from 8·06 log BAU/mL to 7·49 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG responses and from 6·82 log BAU/mL to 7·56 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG responses; mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2: from 8·83 log BAU/mL to 7·95 log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG responses and from 8·50 log BAU/mL to 7·97 log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG responses). No differences in antibody responses 4 weeks after the second dose were noted between the two vaccines, in either homologous or heterologous combinations. Interpretation: Interim results of this ongoing longitudinal study show that among frail, older people, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and the type of mRNA vaccine influenced antibody responses when used with a 16-week interval between doses. In these cohorts of frail, older individuals with a similar age and comorbidity distribution, we found that serological responses were similar and clinically equivalent between the discovery and confirmatory cohorts. Homologous and heterologous use of mRNA vaccines was not associated with significant differences in antibody responses 4 weeks following the second dose, supporting their interchangeability.

Here, this study intends to investigate the acceptability of a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine among child caregivers, aiming to explore the association between risk perception and child vaccine acceptance. Methods: This anonymous, national, cross-sectional survey was conducted for one week from November 12, 2021 in mainland China. The risk perception among child caregivers was assessed based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the individuals was equally divided into three levels according to the total preset scores of each perception dimension. Pearson χ2 test was used to compare the differences among participants stratified by sociodemographic characteristics, health status, knowledge factors and risk perception. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to explore the associations between risk perception and the acceptance of a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Results: A total of 88.46% of 1,724 participants were willing to accept the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for their children. People who lived in central China (91.93%), had a high school or polytechnic school level education (93.98%), and had a history of COVID-19 vaccination (88.80%) were more likely to accept a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for their children. The complicated vaccination process (24.5%) and uncertainty about the safety (16.5%) and efficacy (21.3%) of vaccines were the three main reasons for vaccine hesitancy among child caregivers. The acceptance of the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was closely related to a higher level of perceived susceptibility (moderate: aOR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.07–2.29, P = 0.022; high: aOR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.06–2.89, P = 0.029) and high perceived benefit (high: aOR = 7.22, 95% CI: 2.63–19.79, P < 0.001). The results were stable in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: 88.46% of child caregivers were willing to have a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine to children, and the acceptance was closely associated with a higher level of perceived susceptibility and perceived benefit. The complicated vaccination process, uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines were the main reasons for their hesitancy. Therefore, targeted public health measures to increase perceived susceptibility and benefit are still needed to meet the requirements of higher-level immunization coverage.

Based on the current literature, we review here the various virus mutations and the evolving disease manifestations along with the alterations of immune responses with specific focuses on the innate immune response, neutrophil extracellular traps, humoral immunity, and cellular immunity. Different types of vaccines were compared and analyzed based on their unique properties to elicit specific immunity. Various therapeutic strategies such as antibody, anti-viral medications and inflammation control were discussed. We predict that with the available and continuously emerging new technologies, more powerful vaccines and administration schedules, more effective medications and better public health measures, the COVID-19 pandemic will be under control in the near future.

Understanding contributors to vaccine hesitancy and how they change over time may improve COVID-19 mitigation strategies and public health policies. To date, no mechanism explains how trust in and consumption of different sources of information affect vaccine uptake. A total of 1594 adults enrolled in our COVID-19 testing program completed standardized surveys on demographics, vaccination status, use, reliance, and trust in sources of COVID-19 information, from September to October 2021, during the COVID-19 Delta wave. Of those, 802 individuals ((Formula presented.) %) completed a follow-up survey, from January to February 2022, during the Omicron-wave. Regression analyses were performed to understand contributors to vaccine and booster uptake over time. Individuals vaccinated within two months of eligibility (early vaccinees) tended to have more years of schooling, with greater trust in and consumption of official sources of COVID-19 information, compared to those who waited 3–6 months (late vaccinees), or those who remained unvaccinated at 6 months post-eligibility (non-vaccinees). Most ((Formula presented.) %) early vaccinees took the booster shot, compared to only (Formula presented.) % of late vaccinees, with the latter group gaining trust and consumption of official information after four months. These data provide the foundation for a mechanism based on the level of trust in and consumption of official information sources, where those who increased their level of trust in and consumption of official information sources were more likely to receive a booster. This study shows that social factors, including education and individual-level degree of trust in (and consumption of) sources of COVID-19 information, interact and change over time to be associated with vaccine and booster uptakes. These results are critical for the development of effective public health policies and offer insights into hesitancy over the course of the COVID-19 vaccine and booster rollout. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; information consumption; information trust; vaccine hesitancy","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; decision making; demographics; female; health care personnel; health center; human; immunization; longitudinal study; male; public health; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; self concept; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; vaccinee"

His use of cow pox virus for vaccinating against small pox is the prime example of a live vaccine. Using a virus that has very low virulence for humans and therefore, fits the definition of attenuated. Hesitancy towards a vaccine of this type, much before the science of microbiology and immunology were established, would have been justifiable. In the first half of 20th century, large number of vaccines became available for childhood diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. Around the same time global travel and trade led to escalation in the widespread transmission of diseases caused by microbes. Objective: The objective of this narrative is to offer a balanced view of science behind vaccines, their current status and advances expected in the near future. At the same time the various types of reactions from public at large towards vaccines over past decades are reviewed. Content: This narrative provides a historical perspective of vaccine development, reviews mechanisms of vaccine induced protection, currently available vaccine technologies and vaccines. The focus is on newer vaccines including those utilizing viral vectors and gene based vaccines. Based on the times during which this narrative is being written, messenger RNA vaccines are discussed in detail. Conclusion: The content and review of literature offered in this review makes the impact of vaccines on human life clear. It is also to be accepted that resistance and hesitation towards vaccines is nothing new or limited to vaccines being used during the ongoing pandemic of Covid 19. The continued development of science and products of vaccinology is necessary for further impact on human life. The development of a strong public health infrastructure by nations around the world is the key to improve upon current efforts at public awareness, proactive interventions and appropriate vaccine utilization during all times. Preparedness for epidemics and pandemics would then become more and more efficient than currently in existence. © 2021 Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists","History; Immunology; Vaccines; Virology","Animals; Cattle; Child; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; Vaccines; antibody; cholera vaccine; DNA vaccine; inactivated vaccine; influenza vaccine; liposome; live vaccine; messenger RNA; neutralizing antibody; nucleic acid vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; polysaccharide; recombinant vaccine; respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; RNA vaccine; smallpox vaccine; subunit vaccine; toxoid vaccine; vaccine; vector vaccine; virus vector; antibody detection; antigen specificity; B lymphocyte; bactericidal activity; binding affinity; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; cytokine production; disease transmission; drug delivery system; follicular T helper cell; helper cell; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; immunology; lymph node; memory cell; morbidity; mortality; narrative; Neisseria meningitidis; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; vaccination; vaccine resistance; virology; virus neutralization; animal; bovine; child; female; pandemic; public health"

Rapid mass-scale immunization is critical to prevent further COVID-19-associated deaths. Objectives: Herein, we aimed to evaluate the rapid ramp-up effects of spike antibodies in response to Sputnik V, Sinopharm, and SinoVac first dose administration in the general public of Pakistan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 2000 participants to examine Sputnik V, Sinopharm, and SinoVac first dose effects 21 days post-administration. From 1200 real-time PCR negative subjects, the samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody levels using electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (Elecsys, # 09289267190 Roche, USA). Results: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein positivity was detected highest at 87% among participants receiving SputnikV with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies > 1.5 AU/mL compared to 47.6% and 25% in individuals receiving Sinopharm and SinoVac, respectively. Also, 36.04% of the Sputnik-administered individuals depicted antibody levels > 250 AU/mL. Of the participants, 55% had a previous history of COVID-19. Also, 14.86%, 4.76%, and 0% of the SputnikV, Sinopharm, and SinoVac administered subjects showed antibodies > 100 AU/mL, respectively, while > 25 AU/mL antibodies were found in 10.70% of SputnikV, 19.04% of Sinopharm and 10.71% of SinoVac administered individuals. Moreover, > 1.5-2.5 AU/mL antibodies levels were found in 25.10%, 23.80%, and 14.28% of participants with SputnikV, Sinopharm, and SinoVac administered vaccines, respectively. The antibody titers of < 1.5 AU/mL were detected among 13.30%, 52.38%, and 46.42% of subjects administered with SputnikV, Sinopharm, and SinoVac vaccines, respectively. Conclusions: Even before administrating the second booster dose of SputnikV, a significantly higher number of patients depicted rapid ramp-up of SARS-CoV-2 specific spike antibodies, which can significantly contribute to rapid mass-immunization. Despite all challenges, persistent antibody plateau monitoring is critical to attaining humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infections. © 2022, Author(s).","Antibody; COVID-19 Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2; Sinopharm; SinoVac; Sputnik V","coronavac; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; covilo; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; sputnik v vaccine; streptavidin; adult; antibody titer; Article; cross-sectional study; death; electrochemiluminescence immunoassay; female; human; Human coronavirus 229E; Human coronavirus HKU1; Human coronavirus NL63; Human coronavirus OC43; humoral immunity; immunization; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Pakistan; real time polymerase chain reaction; vaccination"

While most studies used a questionnaire to assess hesitancy, this study aimed to identify factors affecting booster hesitancy by examining actual vaccine uptake across time. Method: COVID‐19 vaccination database records among HCW working at seven Singaporean public primary care clinics between January to December 2021 were extracted, with sex, profession, place of practice, vaccination type, and dates. Time to booster was calculated from the date of vaccination minus date of eligibility. Chi‐square test was used to compare the relationship between first dose and booster hesitancy, Kaplan–Meier method and log‐rank test were adopted to evaluate differences in cumulative booster uptake. Mul-tivariate Cox regression was used to investigate predictors for timely booster vaccination. Vaccination rate was charted across time and corroborated with media releases pertaining to legislative changes. Results: A total of 877 of 891 (98.9%) primary care HCW were fully vaccinated, 73.8% of eligible HCW had taken the booster. HCW were less booster hesitant [median 16 (5–31.3) days] compared to the first dose [median 39 (13–119.3) days]. First dose‐hesitant HCW were more likely to be booster hesitant (OR = 3.66, 95%CI 2.61–5.14). Adjusting for sex, workplace, and time to first dose, ancillary (HR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.03–2.28), medical (HR = 1.8, 95%CI 1.18–2.74), and nursing (HR = 1.8, 95%CI 1.18–2.37) received boosters earlier compared with administrative staff. No temporal relationship was observed between booster uptake, legislative changes, and COVID‐19 infection numbers. Conclusion: Vaccine hesitancy among HCW had improved from first dose to booster, with timely booster vaccination among medical and nursing staff. Tailored education, risk messag-ing, and strategic legislation might help to reduce delayed booster vaccination. © 2022 by the authors.

Mass population immunization and the achievement of collective immunity are of particular importance. The future development of public attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 immunization depends significantly on medical students, as future physicians. Therefore, it seemed relevant to determine the percentage of COVID-19-vaccinated medical students and to identify the factors significantly affecting this indicator. Methods: A total of 2890 medical students from years one to six, studying at nine leading Russian medical universities, participated in an anonymous sociological survey. The study was performed in accordance with the STROBE guidelines. Results: It was found that the percentage of vaccinated Russian medical students at the beginning of the academic year 2021 was 58.8 ± 7.69%, which did not significantly differ from the vaccination coverage of the general population in the corresponding regions (54.19 ± 4.83%). Student vaccination rate was largely determined by the region-specific epidemiological situation. The level of student vaccination coverage did not depend on the gender or student residence (in a family or in a university dormitory). The group of senior students had a higher number of COVID-19 vaccine completers than the group of junior students. The lack of reliable information about COVID-19 vaccines had a pronounced negative impact on the SARS-CoV-2 immunization process. Significant information sources influencing student attitudes toward vaccination included medical professionals, medical universities, academic conferences, and manuscripts, which at that time provided the least information. Conclusion: The obtained results make it possible to develop recommendations to promote SARS-CoV-2 immunoprophylaxis among students and the general population and to increase collective immunity. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 vaccination coverage; COVID-19 vaccination problems; epidemiological indicators; medical students; SARS-CoV-2 immunoprophylaxis","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical; Universities; Vaccination; Russian Federation; COVID-19; disease treatment; epidemiology; health worker; immunization; student; vaccination; vaccine; active immunization; adult; Article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; female; health care personnel; herd immunity; human; immunization; immunoprophylaxis; major clinical study; male; medical research; medical student; morbidity; mortality; pandemic; practice guideline; questionnaire; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social status; student attitude; vaccination; vaccination coverage; visual analog scale; attitude to health; drug therapy; epidemiology; prevention and control; university; vaccination"

In response to the serious pandemic, recently developed vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been administrated to the public. Nevertheless, the research on human immunization response against COVID-19 vaccines is insufficient. Although much information associated with vaccine efficacy, safety and immunogenicity has been reported by pharmaceutical companies based on laboratory studies and clinical trials, vaccine evaluation needs to be extended further to better understand the effect of COVID-19 vaccines on human beings. Methods: We performed a comparative peptidome analysis on serum samples from 95 participants collected at four time points before and after receiving CoronaVac. The collected serum samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to profile the serum peptides, and also subjected to humoral and cellular immune response analyses to obtain typical immunogenicity information. Results: Significant difference in serum peptidome profiles by MALDI-TOF MS was observed after vaccination. By supervised statistical analysis, a total of 13 serum MALDI-TOF MS feature peaks were obtained on day 28 and day 42 of vaccination. The feature peaks were identified as component C1q receptor, CD59 glycoprotein, mannose-binding protein C, platelet basic protein, CD99 antigen, Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein, integral membrane protein 2B, platelet factor 4 and hemoglobin subunits. Combining with immunogenicity analysis, the study provided evidence for the humoral and cellular immune responses activated by CoronaVac. Furthermore, we found that it is possible to distinguish neutralizing antibody (NAbs)-positive from NAbs-negative individuals after complete vaccination using the serum peptidome profiles by MALDI-TOF MS together with machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), linear support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). Conclusions: The study shows the promise of MALDI-TOF MS-based serum peptidome analysis for the assessment of immune responses activated by COVID-19 vaccination, and discovered a panel of serum peptides biomarkers for COVID-19 vaccination and for NAbs generation. The method developed in this study can help not only in the development of new vaccines, but also in the post-marketing evaluation of developed vaccines.

However, the vaccine acts as a practical tool for reducing the massive public health problem and the emerging economic consequences that the continuing COVID -19 epidemic is causing worldwide, while the vaccine efficacy wanes. In this work, we propose and analyze an epidemic model of Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered–Vaccinated population taking into account the rate of vaccination and vaccine waning. The dynamics of the model has been investigated, and the condition for a disease-free endemic equilibrium state is obtained. Further, the analysis is extended to study the COVID-19 spread in India by considering the availability of vaccines and the related critical parameters such as vaccination rate, vaccine efficacy and waning of vaccine’s impact on deciding the emerging fate of this epidemic. We have also discussed the conditions for herd immunity due to vaccinated individuals among the people.

Viruses know no bounds or borders. COVID-19, Monkeypox, and polio are evidence of this. Poliomyelitis was once the leading cause of death and paralysis in the UK and globally. With the introduction of vaccines during the 1950s–1960s, polio was eradicated from most developed countries, including the UK. The last case of wild polio was in 1984, and the UK was polio-free in 2003. The recent detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in London sewage samples is alarming. Routine inoculations were adversely affected due to COVID-19, and UK's wastewater monitoring program was suspended due to economic restrictions. The UK faces several challenges with the burden of COVID-19, Monkeypox, and the return of polio could further burden the already pandemic-stricken healthcare system. To prevent further epidemics in the UK, wastewater sampling remains crucial in evaluating, searching, and eradicating the spread of poliovirus. Further epidemiological surveillance in adjacent areas to the Beckton plant is crucial to filling any gaps in understanding the outbreak's extent and guiding the initiation of appropriate and timely public health measures. The importance of vaccination in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals cannot be overstated, especially in areas where vaccination rates are low. The risk of polio remains globally until its complete eradication from endemic countries. Until elimination, a global effort should be made to minimize the risk and the consequent spread of poliovirus by maintaining strong population immunity levels through high vaccination coverage. © 2022 The Authors","","oral poliomyelitis vaccine; vaccine; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; epidemic; fever; gastroenteritis; headache; human; Human poliovirus 2; immunization; infection; inoculation; Letter; malaise; meningitis; nausea; pandemic; paralysis; poliomyelitis; Poliomyelitis virus; postpoliomyelitis syndrome; public health; respiratory tract infection; sore throat; spinal stiffness; vaccination; wastewater; zoonosis"

Current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually to match circulating strains, resulting in low take-up rates and poor coverage due to inaccurate prediction. Broadly protective universal flu vaccines that do not need to be updated annually have therefore been pursued. The highly conserved 24–amino acid ectodomain of M2 protein (M2e) is a leading candidate, but its poor immunogenicity has been a major roadblock in its clinical development. Here, we report a targeting strategy that shuttles M2e to a specific dendritic cell subset (cDC1) by engineering a recombinant anti-Clec9A monoclonal antibody fused at each of its heavy chains with three copies of M2e. Single administration in mice of 2 μg of the Clec9A–M2e construct triggered an exceptionally sustained anti-M2e antibody response and resulted in a strong anamnestic protective response upon influenza challenge. Furthermore, and importantly, Clec9A–M2e immunization significantly boosted preexisting anti-M2e titers from prior flu exposure. Thus, the Clec9A-targeting strategy allows antigen and dose sparing, addressing the shortcomings of current M2e vaccine candidates. As the cDC1 subset exists in humans, translation to humans is an exciting and realistic avenue. © 2022 the Author(s).","Clec9A; influenza A vaccine; M2e; single shot; universal","Animals; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Pandemics; Viral Matrix Proteins; influenza vaccine; protein M2; influenza vaccine; matrix protein; virus antibody; adult; aged; animal experiment; antibody response; Article; cell subpopulation; controlled study; dendritic cell; drug exposure; immunity; immunization; influenza A; mouse; nonhuman; animal; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; human; influenza; orthomyxovirus infection; pandemic; prevention and control"

This study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of half dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. A non-inferiority non-randomized controlled trial compared a half dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with the full dose, with an interval of 8 to 10 weeks, in individuals aged 18–49 years. The primary endpoints were the incidence rate of new cases/1,000 person-year at 90 days after 14 days of the second dose, confirmed by RT-PCR and new cases registered at SUS National Health Surveillance Database (e-SUS VS). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) by chemiluminescence and the neutralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) were titrated. The soluble biomarkers were quantified with a multiplex immunoassay. Follow-up was 90 days after 14 days of the second dose. A total of 29,598 individuals were vaccinated. After exclusion, 16,570 individuals who received half a dose and 6,402 who received full doses were analyzed. The incidence of new cases confirmed by RT-PCR of half dose was non-inferior to full dose (23.7 vs. 25.7 cases per 1,000 persons-year [coefficient group -0.09 CI95%(-0.49 to 0.31)], even after adjusting for age and sex. There were no deaths or hospitalization after immunization of either group. Immunogenicity was evaluated in a subsample (N=558) compared to 154 healthcare workers who received a full dose. The seroconversion rate in seronegative individuals at baseline half dose was 99.8%, similar to that of the full dose (100%). Geometric mean concentration (95% CI; BAU/mL) were half dose = 188 (163-217) and full dose = 529 (423–663) (p < 0.001). In seropositive subjects at baseline (pre-immune individuals), the first dose induced very high and similar IgG-S in half dose 1,359 (1,245-1,483) and full dose 1,354 (1,048–1,749) BAU/mL. A half dose induced a high increase in plasma chemokines, pro-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines, and growth factors. The frequency of adverse events was similar. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported. A half dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is as effective, safe, and immunogenic as the full dose. The immune response in pre-immune (seropositive in the baseline) individuals indicates that the half dose may be a booster dose schedule.

Since even a slight reduction in vaccine coverage rates can lead to a decrease in herd immunity, it is imperative to explore the underlying factors affecting vaccine hesitancy. This qualitative study protocol aims to explore determinant factors that influence vaccine hesitancy in Iran from the parent's perspective. Methods and analysis Descriptive-Interpretive Qualitative research will be conducted to gain an insight into vaccine hesitancy in the west of Tehran province in Iran. Participants in the study will be recruited from vaccine-hesitant parents of children under 5 years' old who will be recognised as being hesitant to extract from the national health information system. The semistructured interviews and in-depth questions will be performed both face-to-face in an open space such as a park near their homes and via video call because of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing. Interviews will be conducted by a trained qualitative person. Transcribed data will be analysed through thematic analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the research ethics committee at the Iran University of Medical Sciences (Approval ID #IR.IUMS.REC.1399.273). The results of the study are expected to be presented by the end of 2022 year.

Objective: We investigated the magnitude of humoral immune responses, their over-time changes, the frequency of (re)infections and the association with demographic and clinical parameters in Hungarian healthcare workers. Methods: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study in two groups of healthcare workers of a public, county-level teaching hospital. Cohort 1: The anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels of 42 workers (female: 100%) were followed up over 8 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection (June 2020-February 2021). The change in humoral immune response and its associations with age, existing chronic conditions, blood type and severity of symptoms were investigated. Cohort 2: The anti-spike-RBD protein IgG levels of 49 workers (female: 73%) with no prior COVID-19 infection were monitored over 8 months (December 2020-August 2021) following immunisation with two doses of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). Analyses included median analysis, linear regression, ANCOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and Skilling-Mack tests. Results: Cohort 1: IgG levels were on average the highest among those in illness severity category 4, the median time of IgG level reduction below the positive test cut-off was 6 months. Cohort 2: The IgG levels increased 25-fold between the first and second immunisations, but decreased to 6% of the peak level after 210 days. They showed an overall negative association with older age and male sex. The suspected levels of (re)infections were 17% and 14% within the infected and the immunised cohorts, respectively, all symptomless. Those affected all worked on high-risk wards. Conclusion: Both the infected and the immunised cohorts showed significantly declining IgG protections beyond 6 months. The average observed rate of (re)infections was 15%, all asymptomatic. Our findings are confirmative of the effectiveness of vaccination to prevent illness, the importance of booster vaccination due to declining humoral immune protection beyond 6 months, and the potential value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG monitoring.  © Szerzo(k)/The Author(s) 2022.","anti-nucleocapsid-IgG; anti-spike-RBD protein IgG; chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method; mRNA vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 infection","COVID-19; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Hungary; Immunity; Immunoglobulin G; Longitudinal Studies; Male; mRNA Vaccines; Prospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines, Synthetic; coronavirus nucleocapsid protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G antibody; tozinameran; immunoglobulin G; recombinant vaccine; RNA vaccine; age; antibody response; Article; asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019; chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; female; hospital personnel; human; Hungarian (citizen); longitudinal study; male; prospective study; reinfection; sex difference; teaching hospital; health care personnel; Hungary; immunity; vaccination"

The influenza virus has frequent antigenic drifts that can facilitate escape from pre-existing population immunity and lead to the rapid spread and annual seasonal epidemics. Influenza outbreaks occur in crowded settings, such as schools, kindergartens, and nursing homes. Seasonal influenza epidemics can cause 3-5 million severe cases and 290 000-650 000 respiratory disease-related deaths worldwide every year. Pregnant women, infants, adults 60 years and older, and individuals with comorbidities or underlying medical conditions are at the highest risk of severe illness and death from influenza. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some provinces in southern China had a summer peak of influenza. 2019-nCoV may co-circulate with influenza and other respiratory viruses in the upcoming winter-spring influenza season. Annual influenza vaccination is an effective way to prevent influenza, reduce influenza-related severe illness and death, and reduce the harm caused by influenza-related diseases and the use of medical resources. The currently approved influenza vaccines in China include trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3), quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3). IIV3 is produced as a split virus vaccine and subunit vaccine; IIV4 is produced as a split virus vaccine; and LAIV3 is a live, attenuated virus vaccine. Except for some jurisdictions in China, the influenza vaccine is a non-immunization program vaccine- voluntarily and self-paid. China CDC has issued ""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China"" every year from 2018 to 2021. Over the past year, new research evidence has been published at home and abroad. To better guide the prevention and control of influenza and vaccination in China, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccination Technical Working Group updated and revised the 2021-2022 Technical Guidelines with the latest research progress into the ""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China (2022-2023)."" The new version has updated five key areas: (1) new research evidence－especially research conducted in China－has been added, including new estimates of the burden of influenza disease, assessments of influenza vaccine effectiveness and safety, and analyses of the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination; (2) policies and measures for influenza prevention and control that were issued by the government over the past year; (3) influenza vaccines approved for marketing in China this year; (4) composition of trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines for the 2022-2023 northern hemisphere influenza season; and (5) recommendations for influenza vaccination during the 2022-2023 influenza season. The 2022-2023 Guidelines recommend that vaccination clinics provide influenza vaccination services to all people aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and have no contraindications to the influenza vaccine. For adults ≥18 years, co-administration of COVID-19 and inactivated influenza vaccines in separate arms is acceptable regarding immunogenicity and reactogenicity. For people under 18 years old, there should be at least 14 days between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination. The Guidelines express no preference for influenza vaccine type or manufacturer－any approved, age-appropriate influenza vaccines can be used. To minimize harm from influenza and limit the impact on the effort to prevent and control COVID-19 in China, the Technical Guidelines recommend priority vaccination of the following high-risk groups during the upcoming 2022-2023 influenza season: (1) healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, and quarantine professionals; (2) volunteers and staff who provide services and support for large events; (3) people living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staff who take care of vulnerable, at-risk individuals; (4) people who work in high population density settings, including teachers and students in kindergartens and primary and secondary schools, and prisoners and prison staff; and (5) people at high risk of influenza, including adults ≥60 years of age, children 6-59 months of age, individuals with comorbidities or underlying medical conditions, family members and caregivers of infants under 6 months of age, and pregnant women. Children 6 months to 8 years of age who receive inactivated influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses, with an inter-dose interval of 4 or more weeks. Children who previously received the influenza vaccine and anyone 9 years or older need only one dose. LAIV is recommended only for a single dose regardless of the previous influenza vaccination. Vaccination should begin as soon as influenza vaccines become available, and preferably should be completed before the onset of the local influenza season. Repeated influenza vaccination during a single influenza season is not recommended. Vaccination clinics should provide immunization services throughout the epidemic season. Pregnant women can receive inactivated influenza vaccine at any stage of pregnancy. These guidelines are intended for use by staff of CDCs, healthcare workers, maternity and child care institutions and immunization clinic staff members who work on influenza control and prevention. The guidelines will be updated periodically as new evidence becomes available. © 2022 Chinese Medical Association.

To deal with the needs of vaccine, we developed four DNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, based on the full-length spike (S) or truncated S protein. Following mice vaccination, we measured T-cell response and antigen-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer. All four candidates induced humoral immune responses, including elevated levels of total IgG and NAbs, and cell-mediated immune responses, including multiple cytokine expression. However, the full-length S DNA vaccine enhanced the immune responses most significantly. We then evaluated its appropriate antigen dose and vaccination schedule. Although all immunized groups showed higher immune response than the control group, inoculation with 50 μg antigen led to the highest NAb titer. Immunity was significantly increased after the third inoculation. Thus, the full-length S DNA vaccine can potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2022","DNA vaccine; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein","Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Mice; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vaccination; Vaccines, DNA; Viral Vaccines; cytokine; DNA vaccine; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 13; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tumor necrosis factor; virus spike protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; neutralizing antibody; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; virus vaccine; algorithm; animal cell; animal experiment; antibody titer; Article; cellular immunity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; gene sequence; human; human cell; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; immunogenicity; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T lymphocyte; tibialis anterior muscle; virus neutralization; virus neutralization test; Western blotting; animal; genetics; prevention and control; vaccination"

The rapid development of effective vaccines based on different technological platforms represents an unprecedented success for vaccinology, providing a unique opportunity for a successful public health intervention. However, it is widely known that only a limited number of vaccine doses are usually available at the beginning of vaccination campaigns against an emerging virus; in this phase, protecting health care workers and reducing mortality rates is the priority. When a larger number of vaccines become available, the identification of the drivers of virus circulation coupled with the use of transmission blocking vaccines are key to achieve epidemic control through population immunity. However, as we learned during the vaccination campaigns against the pandemic coronavirus, several factors may hamper this process. Thus, flexible plans are required to obtain the best sustainable result with available tools, modulating vaccination strategies in accordance with improved scientific knowledge, and taking into account the duration of protective immune response, virus evolution, and changing epidemic dynamics. © 2022 by the authors.

A COVID-19 vaccination campaign represents the key strategy to combat the pandemic; however, public acceptance of maternal immunization has to be improved, which may be achieved by highlighting the promising mechanism of passive immunity as a strategy for protecting newborns against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response following COVID-19 full-dose vaccination in the serum and amniotic fluid of two pregnant women who presented between April and June 2021, at the Center for the Treatment and Prevention of Infections in Pregnancy of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases “L. Spallanzani”, for antenatal consultancy. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was found in residual samples of amniotic fluid collected from both women at the 18th week of gestation (63 and 131 days after the second dose’s administration). Titers in amniotic fluid mirrored the levels detected in serum and were inversely linked to the time from vaccination. Our results suggest that antibodies elicited by COVID-19 vaccination can cross the placenta and reach the fetus; therefore, they may offer passive immunity at birth. It is critical to fully understand the kinetics of the maternal response to vaccination, the efficiency of IgG transfer, and the persistence of antibodies in infants to optimize maternal immunization regimens. © 2022 by the authors.","amniotic fluid; antibodies; COVID-19; passive immunity; pregnancy; vaccination","Amniotic Fluid; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; immunoglobulin G; maternal antibody; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; tozinameran; virus antibody; adult; amniocentesis; amnion fluid; antibody response; Article; blood sampling; case report; chemiluminescence immunoassay; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; female; follow up; human; immunization; immunofluorescence assay; pandemic; passive immunization; placenta; pregnancy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; toxoplasmosis; vaccination; vertical transmission; amnion fluid; infant; newborn; pregnancy complication; prevention and control; vaccination"

The vaccination of children and adolescents has been extensively debated and the first COVID-19 vaccine is now approved in European countries for children aged > 12 years of age. Our study investigates vaccination hesitancy in a cohort of German secondary school students. We assessed 903 students between age 9 and 20 in the period between 17 May 2021 and 30 June 2021. 68.3% (n = 617) reported intention to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, while 7% (n = 62) did not want to receive the vaccine and 15% (n = 135) were not yet certain. Age and parental level of education influenced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Children under the age of 16 as well as students whose parents had lower education levels showed significantly higher vaccine hesitancy. Conclusion: Identifying subsets with higher vaccination hesitancy is important for targeting public information campaigns in support of immunization.What is Known:• The willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among adults in Europe is about 70%, but data for children and adolescents is lacking.• The lack of immunization in younger cohorts represents a significant barrier to achieving herd immunity, and also leaves children and adolescents vulnerable to acute and long-term morbidity from natural COVID-19 infections.What is New:• Intention-to-vaccinate among children and adolescents is high (~ 70%); conversely, vaccination hesitancy is low.• Age and parental level of education influenced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among children and adolescents. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adolescents; Children; COVID-19; Vaccination; Vaccine hesitancy","Adolescent; Adult; Child; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Humans; Parents; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Vaccination; Vaccination Hesitancy; Young Adult; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adolescent; adult; allergy; Article; asthma; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; blood sampling; child; chronic disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; educational status; female; Germany; graduate; high school; human; major clinical study; male; parent; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccine hesitancy; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; educational status; epidemiology; prevention and control; student; vaccination; young adult"

Despite global efforts to increase access to vaccination, the World Health Organization explicitly lists vaccination hesitancy (VH) as a significant threat. Despite robust safety reports from regulatory authorities and public health advisories, a substantial proportion of the community remains obsessed with the hazards of vaccination. This calls for identifying and eliminating possible causative elements, among which this study investigates the inappropriate dissemination of medical literature concerning COVID‐19 and adverse events following immunization (AEFI), its influence on promoting VH, and proposals for overcoming this problem in the future. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases, using the keywords “adverse events following immunization (AEFI),” “COVID‐19”, “vaccines,” and “hesitancy”, and related medical and subjective headings (MeSH) up to 31st March 2022, and extracted studies relevant to the COVID‐19 AEFI and associated VH. Finally, 47 articles were chosen to generate a narrative synthesis. Results: The databases depicted a steep rise in publications on COVID‐19 AEFI and COVID‐ 19 VH from January 2021 onwards. The articles depicted multiple events of mild AEFIs without fatal events in recipients. While documenting AEFIs is praiseworthy, publishing such reports without prior expert surveillance can exaggerate public apprehension and inappropriately fuel VH. VH is a deep‐rooted phenomenon, but it is difficult to zero in on the exact reason for it. Spreading rumors/misinformation on COVID‐19 vaccines might be an important provocation for VH, which includes indiscriminately reporting AEFI on a massive scale. While a number of reported AEFIs fall within the acceptable limits in the course of extensive COVID‐19 vaccinations, it is important to critically evaluate and moderate the reporting and dissemination of AEFI in order to allay panic. Conclusions: Vaccination programs are necessary to end any pandemic, and VH may be attributed to multiple reasons. VH may be assuaged by initiating educational programs on the importance of vaccination, raising public awareness and monitoring the inappropriate dissemination of misleading information. Government‐initiated strategies can potentially restrict random AEFI reports from lay epidemiologists and healthcare practitioners. © 2022 by the authors.

Correspondingly, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been developed and administered worldwide, varying in design strategies, delivery routes, immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Here, a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectored recombinant COVID-19 vaccine was constructed and evaluated in BALB/c mice and Syrian golden hamsters. In BALB/c mice, intramuscular (i.m.) inoculation of recombinant vaccine induced significantly higher humoral immune response than that of the intranasal (i.n.) inoculation group. Analyses of cellular immunity revealed that a Th1-biased cellular immune response was induced in i.n. inoculation group while both Th1 and Th2 T cells were activated in i.m. inoculation group. In golden hamsters, i.n. inoculation of the recombinant vaccine triggered robust humoral immune response and conferred prominent protective efficacy post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge, indicating a better protective immunity in the i.n. inoculation group than that of the i.m. inoculation group. This study provides an effective i.n.-delivered recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate and elucidates a route-dependent manner of this vaccine candidate in two most frequently applied small animal models. Moreover, the golden hamster is presented as an economical and convenient small animal model that precisely reflects the immune response and protective efficacy induced by replication-competent COVID-19 vaccine candidates in other SARS-CoV-2 susceptible animals and human beings, especially in the exploration of i.n. immunization. © 2022 by the authors.

The vaccinated without validity group (partially vaccinated; past 1-2 doses with expired Green Passes) showed significantly lower infection rates (X2 [1, N=15727]=295.3, p<0.001) during December 5,2021-January 29, 2022 period compared to vaccinated with validity (95% of them received third booster dose, and have Green Pass access) group that showed significantly increased infection rates and substantially increased percentages of severe illness and deaths. Vaccination with the third booster associated with brief protection and higher breakthrough infections compared to prior vaccination with two doses. The vaccinated population, who are considered immune according to the new vaccination policy, showed significantly increased infections, substantial increases in severe illness, and deaths during Omicron surge. However, those considered non-immune showed significantly decreased infections. There was a stronger association between public health restrictions and infections among the vaccinated groups. There is an urgent need to protect the elderly population by adopting uni-form protective measures and surveillance pro-tocols. © 2022, Association of Biotechnology and Pharmacy.

Hesitation to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine stems from the argument of bodily autonomy, novel mRNA vaccine technology, and conspiracy theories. However, vaccinations may prevent thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. HCWs have previously complied with other required vaccinations to care for children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Yet, COVID-19 vaccination mandates in the healthcare setting have been faced with resistance and subsequent staffing shortages. As HCWs display their hesitation to the vaccine, the community loses trust in its efficacy and safety. Speculation on pharmaceutical profiteering has also contributed to vaccine mistrust. As the pandemic continues, the healthcare field must decide on a course of action: adhere to vaccination mandates and cope with decreased staffing, repeal vaccination mandates to recover staff, rely on personal protective equipment (PPE) alone for protection, or do nothing and expect survival through herd immunity. To date, the United States has chosen to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for any healthcare worker employed by Medicare and/or Medicaid-accepting facilities, allowing allergy and religious exemptions. This COVID-19 vaccination mandate for HCWs ethically protects the vulnerable people who HCWs vow to care for. © 2022 by the authors.","community health; corona virus; COVID-19; healthcare workers; pandemic; public health; vaccine mandates; vaccines","influenza vaccine; messenger RNA; RNA vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; aged; anaphylaxis; Article; bacteriophage; child; conspiracy theory; coronavirus disease 2019; government; health care organization; health care personnel; health care policy; health care system; health insurance; herd immunity; hospitalization; human; immunization; immunotherapy; infection control; law; medicaid; medicare; pandemic; patient care; phage therapy; profiteering; public health; scientific literature; United States; vaccination; vulnerable population"

However, current evidence is limited to single social media platforms. Our objective was to compare arguments used by anti-vaxxers in the context of COVID-19 vaccines across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. We obtained the data set of 53,671 comments regarding COVID-19 vaccination published between August 2021 and February 2022. After that, we established categories of anti-vaccine content, manually classified comments, and compared the frequency of occurrence of the categories between social media platforms. We found that anti-vaxxers on social media use 14 categories of arguments against COVID-19 vaccines. The frequency of these categories varies across different social media platforms. The anti-vaxxers’ activity on Facebook and Twitter is similar, focusing mainly on distrust of government and allegations regarding vaccination safety and effectiveness. Anti-vaxxers on TikTok mainly focus on personal freedom, while Instagram users encouraging vaccination often face criticism suggesting that vaccination is a private matter that should not be shared. Due to the differences in vaccine sentiment among users of different social media platforms, future research and educational campaigns should consider these distinctions, focusing more on the platforms popular among adolescents (i.e., Instagram and TikTok). © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19 vaccine; Facebook; Instagram; public health; social media; TikTok; Twitter; vaccine hesitancy","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; algorithm; anti-vaccination movement; antifungal activity; Article; content analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; distrust; drug safety; freedom; government; human; immunization; innate immunity; interrater reliability; medical research; motivation; parental consent; perception; public health; publication; social media; teleconsultation; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy"

Although several vaccines are available, the global supply of vaccines, particularly within developing countries, is inadequate, and this necessitates a need for the development of less expensive, accessible vaccine options. To this end, here, we used the Escherichia coli expression system to produce a recombinant fusion protein comprising the receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; residues 319–541) and the fragment A domain of Cross-Reacting Material 197 (CRM197); hereafter, CRMA-RBD. We show that this CRMA-RBD fusion protein has excellent physicochemical properties and strong reactivity with COVID-19 convalescent sera and representative neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Furthermore, compared with the use of a traditional aluminum adjuvant, we find that combining the CRMA-RBD protein with a nitrogen bisphosphonate-modified zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH-002C-Ac) leads to stronger humoral immune responses in mice, with 4-log neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, our study highlights the value of this E. coli-expressed fusion protein as an alternative vaccine candidate strategy against COVID-19.

The aim of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We searched a range of databases (Embase, Medline, Psychology & Behavioral Science, PsycInfo, Web of Science and NIH Preprints Portfolio) from March 2020 to July 2021 for studies which reported primary quantitative or qualitative research on interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Outcome measures included vaccination uptake and reported intention to vaccinate. Reviews, position papers, conference abstracts, protocol papers and papers not in English were excluded. The NHLBI quality assessment was used to assess risk of bias. In total, 39 studies across 33 papers met the inclusion criteria. A total of 28 were assessed as good quality. They included interventions relating to communication content, communication delivery, communication presentation, policy or vaccination delivery, with 7 measuring vaccination uptake and 32 measuring vaccination intention. A narrative synthesis was conducted, which highlighted that there is reasonable evidence from studies investigating real behaviour suggesting that personalising communications and sending booking reminders via text message increases vaccine uptake. Findings on vaccination intention are mixed but suggest that communicating uncertainty about the vaccine does not decrease intention, whereas making vaccination mandatory could have a negative impact. Although much of the research used experimental designs, very few measured real behavioural outcomes. Understanding which interventions are most effective amongst vaccine-hesitant populations and in the context of booster vaccinations will be important as vaccine roll outs continue across the world. © 2022 by the authors.

Aim: Hence, this narrative review aims to provide critical insight for reviving the heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination relative to a brief positive outlook on the mix-dose approach deployed in previous and existing outbreaks (ie, Ebola virus disease (EVD), malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, HIV and influenza virus). Methodology and Materials: A Boolean search was carried out to find the literature in MEDLINE-PubMed, Clinicaltrials, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases up till December 22, 2021, using the specific keywords that include “SARS-CoV2”, “COVID-19”, “Ebola,” “Malaria,” “Tuberculosis,” “Human Immunodeficiency Virus,” “Hepatitis B,” “Influenza,” “Mix and match,” “Heterologous prime-boost,” with interposition of “OR” and “AND.” Full text of all the related articles in English language with supplementary appendix was retrieved. In addition, the full text of relevant cross-references was also retrieved. Results: Therefore, as generally evident by the primary outcomes, that is, safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity reported and updated by preclinical and clinical studies for addressing previous and existing outbreaks so far, including COVID-19, it is understood that heterologous prime-boost immunization has been proven successful for eliciting a more efficacious immune response as of yet in comparison to the traditional homologous prime-boost immunization regimen. Discussion: Accordingly, with increasing cases of COVID-19, many countries such as Germany, Pakistan, Canada, Thailand, and the United Kingdom have started administering the heterologous vaccination as the technique aids to rationalize the usage of the available vaccines to aid in the global race to vaccinate majority to curb the spread of COVID-19 efficiently. However, the article emphasizes the need for more large controlled trials considering demographic details of vaccine recipients, which would play an essential role in clearing the mistrust about safety concerns to pace up the acceptance of the technique across the globe. Conclusion: Consequently, by combatting the back-to-back waves of COVID-19 and other challenging variants of concerns, including Omicron, the discussed approach can also help in addressing the expected evolution of priority outbreaks as coined by WHO, that is, “Disease X” in 2018 with competency, which according to WHO can turn into the “next pandemic” or the “next public health emergency,” thus would eventually lead to eradicating the risk of “population crisis.”. © 2022 The Authors.

In this way, the authors attempt to raise awareness on the transversal nature of these challenges by identifying the main risk/vulnerability factors that the scientific community must face including our current knowledge on the virus capacity of the mechanism of entry into the cells, the current classifications of viral variants, the knowledge of the mathematical model on the spread of viruses (the possible routes of transmission), and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in a global context of pandemic, particularly from COVID-19, with a look at new or future vaccines. © 2022 by the authors.","clinical microbiology; COVID-19; global health; human vaccines; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; baricitinib; dexamethasone; Ebola vaccine; remdesivir; tocilizumab; COVID-19; disease transmission; future prospect; infectious disease; pandemic; public health; vaccination; adaptive immunity; advocacy group; apoptosis; awareness; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; economic aspect; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fatigue; fever; gene expression; genetic variability; headache; human; immune response; immunization; immunofluorescence; influenza; Influenza virus; malaria; mathematical model; microbial diversity; morbidity; mortality; Orthopoxvirus; pandemic; review; Review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; Streptococcus pneumoniae; telemedicine; vaccination; virus shedding; virus transmission; Zika fever"

COVID-19 vaccines, including the two mRNA vaccines, were developed to help mitigate COVID-19 and to move society towards herd immunity. Despite the strong efficacy and effectiveness profile of these vaccines, there remains a degree of vaccine hesitancy among the population. To better understand hesitancy associated with COVID-19 vaccines and to delineate between those who are vaccine acceptors, vaccine refusers, and the moveable middle, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to understand respondents’ decision to receive, or not, a COVID-19 vaccine at the onset of mRNA vaccine availability in Central Texas. A total of 737 individuals responded, with 685 responses classified to one of eight domains: A: End to the Pandemic (n = 48); B: Trust in Medical Community (n = 27); C: Illness-Focused Perceptions (n = 331); D: Social Motivation (n = 54); E: Vaccine-Focused Perceptions (n = 183); F: Knowledge Gap (n = 14); G: Underlying Health Concern (n = 9); and H: Undecided (n = 19). Vaccine acceptors (n = 535) were primarily represented in domains A–E, while vaccine refusers (n = 26) were primarily represented in domains C, E, G, and H. The moveable middle (n = 124) was primarily represented by domains C–H. These findings show clear delineations between vaccine acceptors, vaccine refusers, and the moveable middle across eight domains that can assist public health professionals in addressing vaccine hesitancy. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; moveable middle; sendero health plans; vaccine acceptors; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine refusers","messenger RNA; RNA vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; analysis; Article; community; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; education; female; health care survey; herd immunity; household income; human; immunization; knowledge; major clinical study; male; marriage; middle aged; morbidity; mortality; motivation; pandemic; public health; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; risk; vaccine hesitancy; young adult"

Several vaccines have been developed to control the pandemic with varying effectiveness and safety profiles. One of the biggest obstacles to implementing successful vaccination programmes is vaccine hesitancy stemming from concerns about effectiveness and safety. This review aims to identify the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance and to organize the factors using the social ecological framework. Methods We adopted the five-stage methodological framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley to guide this scoping review. Selection criteria was based on the PICo (Population, Phenomenon of interest and Context) framework. Factors associated with acceptance and hesitancy were grouped into the following: intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy factors using the social ecological framework. Results Fifty-one studies fulfilled this review’s inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America, followed by Asia and the Middle East. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy rates varied across countries. Some common demographic factors associated with hesitancy were younger age, being female, having lower than college education, and having a lower income level. Most of the barriers and facilitators to acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines were intrapersonal factors, such as personal characteristics and preferences, concerns with COVID-19 vaccines, history/perception of general vaccination, and knowledge of COVID-19 and health. The remaining interpersonal, institution, community, and public policy factors were grouped into factors identified as barriers and facilitators. Conclusion Our review identified barriers and facilitators of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy and organised them using the social ecological framework. While some barriers and facilitators such as vaccine safety are universal, differentiated barriers might exist for different target groups, which need to be understood if they are to be addressed to maximize vaccine acceptance. © 2022 Lun et al.

We report our findings regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike-binding antibody stability and protection from infection in the pre-variant era. We analyzed data from 400 health care workers (150 seropositive and 250 seronegative at enrollment) for a median of 84 days. The SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibody titers were highly variable with antibody levels decreasing over the first 3 months, followed by a relative stabilization. We found that both more advanced age (> 40 years) and female sex were associated with higher antibody levels (1.6-fold and 1.4-fold increases, respectively). Only six percent of the initially seropositive participants “seroreverted.” We documented a total of 11 new SARS-CoV-2 infections (10 naive participants and 1 previously infected participant without detectable antibodies; P < 0.01), indicating that spike antibodies limit the risk of reinfection. These observations, however, only apply to SARS-CoV-2 variants antigenically similar to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 ones. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers mounted upon infection are stable over several months and provide protection from infection with antigenically similar viruses. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of one of the largest noninfluenza pandemics of this century. This exceptional public health crisis highlights the urgent need for better understanding of the correlates of protection from infection and severe COVID-19. We established the PARIS cohort to determine durability and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Here, we report on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibody after SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as reinfection rates using data collected between April 2020 and August 2021. We found that antibody levels stabilized at individual steady state levels after an initial decrease with seroreversion being found in only 6% of the convalescent participants. SARS-CoV-2 infections only occurred in participants without detectable spike-binding antibodies, indicating significant protection from reinfection with antigenically similar viruses. Our data indicate the importance of spike-binding antibody titers in protection prior to vaccination and the wide circulation of antigenically diverse variants of concern.

The mRNA technology has the advantage of accelerated immunogen discovery, induction of robust immune responses, and rapid scale up of manufacturing. Efforts to develop genital herpes vaccines have been ongoing for 8 decades without success. The advent of mRNA technology has the potential to change that narrative. Developing a genital herpes vaccine is a high public health priority. A prophylactic genital herpes vaccine should prevent HSV-1 and HSV-2 genital lesions and infection of dorsal root ganglia, the site of latency. Vaccine immunity should be durable for decades, perhaps with the assistance of booster doses. While these goals have been elusive, new efforts with nucleoside-modified mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines show great promise. We review past approaches to vaccine development that were unsuccessful or partially successful in large phase 3 trials, and describe lessons learned from these trials. We discuss our trivalent mRNA-lipid nanoparticle approach for a prophylactic genital herpes vaccine and the ability of the vaccine to induce higher titers of neutralizing antibodies and more durable CD4+ T follicular helper cell and memory B cell responses than protein-adjuvanted vaccines. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","","Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; Herpes Genitalis; Humans; Liposomes; mRNA Vaccines; Nanoparticles; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines, Synthetic; Viral Envelope Proteins; CD4 antigen; complement component C3b; Fc receptor; herpes vaccine; lipid nanoparticle; live vaccine; messenger RNA; nucleoside; perforin; RNA vaccine; vaccine adjuvant; Lipid Nanoparticles; liposome; nanoparticle; recombinant vaccine; RNA vaccine; virus antibody; virus envelope protein; adaptive immunity; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; complement activation; cytotoxicity; encapsulation; endocytosis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; genital herpes; genital tract infection; glycosylation; helper cell; Herpes simplex virus 2; human; humoral immunity; immune response; immunity; immunization; innate immunity; memory cell; newborn infection; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); public health; Review; seroconversion; seroprevalence; spinal ganglion; Tfh cell; vaccination; virus attenuation; virus replication; virus shedding; virus transmission; Zika fever; genetics; genital herpes"

The emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants of concern (VoC) and evidence that existing vaccines that were designed to protect from the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 may have reduced potency for protection from infection against these VoC is driving continued development of second generation vaccines that can protect against multiple VoC. In this report, we evaluated an alphavirus-based replicating RNA vaccine expressing Spike proteins from the original SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strain and recent VoCs delivered in vivo via a lipid inorganic nanoparticle. Vaccination of both mice and Syrian Golden hamsters showed that vaccination induced potent neutralizing titers against each homologous VoC but reduced neutralization against heterologous challenges. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with homologous SARS-CoV2 variants exhibited complete protection from infection. In addition, vaccinated hamsters challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited significantly reduced shedding of infectious virus. Our data demonstrate that this vaccine platform can be updated to target emergent VoCs, elicits significant protective immunity against SARS-CoV2 variants and supports continued development of this platform. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

As a result, effective vaccines are critical for bringing the pandemic to an end and restoring normalcy in society. Several potential COVID-19 vaccines are now being researched, developed, tested, and reviewed. Since the end of June 2022, several vaccines have been provisionally approved, whereas others are about to be approved.

Envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins are highly conserved structural proteins among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and have been proposed as potential targets for the development of cross-protective vaccines. Here, synthetic DNA vaccines encoding SARS-CoV-2 E/M proteins (called p-SARS-CoV-2-E/M) were developed, and mice were immunised with three doses via intramuscular injection and electroporation. Significant cellular immune responses were elicited, whereas no robust humoral immunity was detected. In addition, novel H-2d-restricted T-cell epitopes were identified. Notably, although no drop in lung tissue virus titre was detected in DNA-vaccinated mice post-challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunisation with either p-SARS-CoV-2-E or p-SARS-CoV-2-M provided minor protection and co-immunisation with p-SARS-CoV-2-E+M increased protection. Therefore, E/M proteins should be considered as vaccine candidates as they may be valuable in the optimisation of vaccination strategies against COVID-19.

However, the rise of COVID-19 resulted in global disruption to routine immunisation activities. Such disruptions could have a detrimental effect on public health, leading to more deaths from VPDs, particularly without mitigation efforts. Hence, as routine immunisation activities resume, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of different approaches for recovery. We apply an impact extrapolation method developed by the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium to estimate the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions with different recovery scenarios for ten VPDs across 112 LMICs. We focus on deaths averted due to routine immunisations occurring in the years 2020–2030 and investigate two recovery scenarios relative to a no-COVID-19 scenario. In the recovery scenarios, we assume a 10% COVID-19-related drop in routine immunisation coverage in the year 2020. We then linearly interpolate coverage to the year 2030 to investigate two routes to recovery, whereby the immunization agenda (IA2030) targets are reached by 2030 or fall short by 10%. We estimate that falling short of the IA2030 targets by 10% leads to 11.26% fewer fully vaccinated persons (FVPs) and 11.34% more deaths over the years 2020–2030 relative to the no-COVID-19 scenario, whereas, reaching the IA2030 targets reduces these proportions to 5% fewer FVPs and 5.22% more deaths. The impact of the disruption varies across the VPDs with diseases where coverage expands drastically in future years facing a smaller detrimental effect. Overall, our results show that drops in routine immunisation coverage could result in more deaths due to VPDs. As the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions is dependent on the vaccination coverage that is achieved over the coming years, the continued efforts of building up coverage and addressing gaps in immunity are vital in the road to recovery. © 2022 The Authors","COVID-19; Mathematical modelling; Vaccines","COVID-19; Humans; Immunization; Immunization Programs; Vaccination; Vaccine-Preventable Diseases; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Haemophilus infection; health care delivery; hepatitis B; human; immune response; immunization; Japanese encephalitis; low income country; mathematical model; measles; meningococcosis; middle income country; morbidity; mortality; mortality risk; pandemic; papillomavirus infection; pneumococcal infection; risk reduction; Rotavirus infection; rubella; vaccination coverage; vaccine preventable disease; yellow fever; epidemiology; immunization; prevention and control; preventive health service; procedures; vaccination"

It is necessary to develop a bivalent vaccine to control these two infectious diseases simultaneously. In this study, we generated three attenuated replicating recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine candidates against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. These rVSV-based vaccines coexpress SARS-CoV-2 Delta spike protein (SP) bearing the C-terminal 17 amino acid (aa) deletion (SPDC) and I742A point mutation, or the SPDC with a deletion of S2 domain, or the RBD domain, and a tandem repeat harboring four copies of the highly conserved influenza M2 ectodomain (M2e) that fused with the Ebola glycoprotein DC-targeting/activation domain. Animal immunization studies have shown that these rVSV bivalent vaccines induced efficient humoral and cellular immune responses against both SARS-CoV-2 SP and influenza M2 protein, including high levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and other variant SP-pseudovirus infections. Importantly, immunization of the rVSV bivalent vaccines effectively protected hamsters or mice against the challenges of SARSCoV- 2 Delta variant and lethal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and significantly reduced respiratory viral loads. Overall, this study provides convincing evidence for the high efficacy of this bivalent vaccine platform to be used and/or easily adapted to produce new vaccines against new or reemerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and influenza A virus infections.  © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.","bivalent vaccine; ectodomain; influenza; M2 protein; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant; spike protein; VSV vector","Amino Acids; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; Cricetinae; Glycoproteins; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Mice; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vaccines, Combined; Vaccines, Synthetic; Vesicular Stomatitis; Vesiculovirus; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; gamma interferon; influenza vaccine; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; neutralizing antibody; protein M2; recombinant vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; virus glycoprotein; virus vector; amino acid; glycoprotein; influenza vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; vaccine; virus antibody; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; cellular immunity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; drug synthesis; female; gene deletion; human; human cell; humoral immunity; immunization; influenza A; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); mouse; nonhuman; point mutation; protein domain; protein expression; receptor binding domain; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus; spleen cell; Syrian hamster; tandem repeat; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; Vesiculovirus; virus load; animal; genetics; hamster; influenza; Influenza A virus (H1N1); vesicular stomatitis; Vesiculovirus"

Because sleep and immunity are bidirectionally linked, sleepiness or sleep disturbance side effects reported after some of the COVID-19 vaccines advise an academic research line in the context of physiological or pathological neuroimmune interactions. On the recognized basis of inflammatory regulation of hypothalamic neurons in sickness behavior, we hypothesized that IL-1β, INF-γ and TNF-α pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibit orexinergic neurons promoting sleepiness after peripheral activation of the innate immune system induced by the novel COVID-19 vaccines.

To tackle this challenge, investments in pathogen surveillance, systematic variant characterization, and data infrastructure and sharing across public and private sectors will be critical for planning proactive responses to emerging variants. Additionally, an emphasis on incorporating real-time variant identification in point-of-care diagnostics can help inform patient treatment. Active approaches to understand and identify “immunity gaps” can inform design of future vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics that will be more resistant to novel variants.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on how the COVID-19 vaccine affects mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The present study investigated the psychological effects and associated factors among vaccinated and unvaccinated general populations against COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. Methods: A nationwide online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Bangladesh from June 23 to December 25, 2021. The frequency of symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, and fear was assessed using the Bangla versions of the GHQ-12, PHQ-2, GAD-2, PSS-4, PC-PTSD-5, ISI, and FCV-19S scales, respectively. Results: The study included 3,013 persons from all eight divisions of Bangladesh, with 1,272 (42.2%) being vaccinated and 1,741 (57.8%) being unvaccinated. Compared with unvaccinated populations, vaccinated populations had significantly lower prevalence rates of psychological distress (36.4 vs. 51.5%), depression (21.1 vs. 37.9%), anxiety (25.1 vs. 44.9%), stress (19.4 vs. 30.4%), PTSD (29.4 vs. 38.3%), insomnia (18.7 vs. 39.4%), and fear symptoms (16.1 vs. 27.5%). Among vaccinated populations, respondents who lived in nuclear families were significantly associated with higher risk of psychological distress (AOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09–1.78), depression (AOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.11–1.98), anxiety (AOR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21–1.98), and fear (AOR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.11–1.83) symptoms. Participants who lost family members, friends, or colleagues due to the COVID-19 pandemic had significantly higher risk of symptoms of psychological distress (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.02–1.79), anxiety (AOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.11–1.87), and PTSD (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.24–2.19). On the other hand, unvaccinated populations who lived in the Dhaka division were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression (AOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.40–2.52), anxiety (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15–2.47), stress (AOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.12–2.88), and insomnia (AOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.20–2.94) symptoms. Except for PTSD and fear symptoms, unemployed participants had considerably higher rates of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms (e.g., psychological distress: AOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10–2.62; depression: AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.37–2.19). Conclusions: This study recommends immunizing unvaccinated populations as soon as possible to prevent infection and boost mental health. Vulnerable people needed special care, health-related education, and psychological assistance.

Using a vignette experiment, we examine the extent of normative expectations in normalizing pro-vaccination behavior beyond an individual’s reference group.

This review explores whether this rise was due to an increased transmission of the variant or its escape from population immunity by an extensively mutated spike protein. The mutations affected the structure of the spike protein leading to the loss of neutralization by most, but not all, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Omicron also shows substantial immune escape from serum antibodies in convalescent patients and vaccinees. A booster immunization increased, however, the titre and breadth of antiviral antibody response. The cellular immune response against Omicron was largely preserved explaining a satisfying protection of boosted vaccinees against severe infections. Clinicians observed less severe infection with Omicron, but other scientists warned that this must not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed a lesser virulence than previous VOCs and lung functions were less compromised. Cell biologists demonstrated that Omicron differs from Delta by preferring the endocytic pathway for cell entry over fusion with the plasma membrane which might explain Omicron’s distinct replication along the respiratory tract compared with Delta. Omicron represents a distinct evolutionary lineage that deviated from the mainstream of evolving SARS-CoV-2 already in mid-2020 raising questions about where it circulated before getting widespread in December 2021. The role of Omicron for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed. © 2022 The Authors.

To alleviate the pressure on the PCR testing capacity, many provinces implemented new strategies that promote self testing and adjust the eligibility for PCR tests, making the count of new cases underreported. We designed a novel compartmental model which captures the new testing guidelines, social behaviours, booster vaccines campaign and features of the newest variant Omicron. To better describe the testing eligibility, we considered the population divided into high risk and non-high-risk settings. The model is calibrated using data from January 1 to February 9, 2022, on cases and severe outcomes in Canada, the province of Ontario and City of Toronto. We conduct analyses on the impact of PCR testing capacity, self testing, different levels of reopening and vaccination coverage on cases and severe outcomes. Our results show that the total number of cases in Canada, Ontario and Toronto are 2.34 (95%CI: 1.22–3.38), 2.20 (95%CI: 1.15–3.72), and 1.97(95%CI: 1.13–3.41), times larger than reported cases, respectively. The current testing strategy is efficient if partial restrictions, such as limited capacity in public spaces, are implemented. Allowing more people to have access to PCR reduces the daily cases and severe outcomes; however, if PCR test capacity is insufficient, then it is important to promote self testing. Also, we found that reopening to a pre-pandemic level will lead to a resurgence of the infections, peaking in late March or April 2022. Vaccination and adherence to isolation protocols are important supports to the testing policies to mitigate any possible spread of the virus. © 2022 The Authors","Booster dose; COVID-19; Exit strategy; Mathematical model; Omicron; PCR testing; Self-testing; Social behavior","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; education; hospital; human; human experiment; immunity; immunization; intensive care unit; mathematical model; normal human; polymerase chain reaction; population size; self-testing; sensitivity analysis; seroprevalence; social behavior; vaccination; virus transmission"

Various vaccines have been developed to combat it. This study is aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among the Nepalese population through a web-based survey. Materials and methods This is a web-based cross-sectional descriptive study of Nepalese people 18 years and above from different regions of Nepal who use social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) as well as instant messaging applications (Messenger, Viber, WhatsApp). The duration of the study was 3 months from 1st June 2021 to 31st August 2021. The sampling technique used was self-selected non-probability sampling. A validated questionnaire had been taken to record the data. Results A total of 307 participants were included in the study. About three-fourths of participants 231 (75.2%) had not been vaccinated while 76 (24.8%) had been vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine. Out of 231 non-vaccinated participants, most of participants 213 (92.2%) had shown acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. More than two-thirds of participants believed that the vaccine would protect them, their family members, and the community from having COVID-19 in the future. Very few participants 18 (7.2%) were hesitant to receive the vaccine against COVID-19. About two-thirds of participants were being afraid of adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine while more than half of participants hesitated due to lack of enough information regarding COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion This study can aid in the planning of vaccination campaigns and the direction of future public health efforts aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake. © 2022 Dahal et al.

At its most basic, (Formula presented.) is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one primary infected individual. (Formula presented.) seems convenient, because the epidemic is expanding if (Formula presented.) and contracting if (Formula presented.). The magnitude of (Formula presented.) indicates by how much transmission needs to be reduced to control the epidemic. Using (Formula presented.) in a naïve way can cause new problems. The reasons for this are threefold: (1) There is not just one definition of (Formula presented.) but many, and the precise definition of (Formula presented.) affects both its estimated value and how it should be interpreted. (2) Even with a particular clearly defined (Formula presented.), there may be different statistical methods used to estimate its value, and the choice of method will affect the estimate. (3) The availability and type of data used to estimate (Formula presented.) vary, and it is not always clear what data should be included in the estimation. In this review, we discuss when (Formula presented.) is useful, when it may be of use but needs to be interpreted with care, and when it may be an inappropriate indicator of the progress of the epidemic. We also argue that careful definition of (Formula presented.), and the data and methods used to estimate it, can make (Formula presented.) a more useful metric for future management of the epidemic. © The Author(s) 2021.","COVID-19 pandemic; Reproduction number","Basic Reproduction Number; COVID-19; Forecasting; Humans; Pandemics; Reproduction; Article; basic reproduction number; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; critical vaccination threshold; cycle threshold value; disease transmission; epidemic; herd immunity; hospitalization; household; human; immunization; intensive care unit; mathematical model; mortality; pandemic; population size; prevalence; public health; quarantine; reinfection; reproduction number R; school; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social behavior; social network; stochastic model; vaccination; virus shedding; virus transmission; workplace; basic reproduction number; epidemiology; forecasting; pandemic; reproduction"

People living with HIV (PLWH) appear to have an elevated risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, yet the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in this population remains unclear due to the limited research efforts in this population in the real world. This study aims to characterise and compare the breakthrough COVID-19 (eg, prevalence and disease severity) between PLWH and non-PLWH and then examine whether HIV markers play a role in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness within the PLWH population. Methods and analysis This cohort study will merge electronic health records data from multiple data sources in South Carolina (SC), including the ' HIV Cohort' (n=12 203) identified from the statewide Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System, ' Vaccine Cohort' from the Statewide Immunisation Online Network which provides patient-level immunisation records (n=∼1.71 million), and ' COVID-19 Cohort' which includes healthcare encounters and COVID-19 diagnosis information for all individuals who were tested for COVID-19 (n=∼3.41 million). The PLWH will be matched with a comparison group of non-PLWH by the propensity score matching method. To distinguish the role of immunity level in affecting the vaccine effectiveness, we will conduct subgroup analyses to compare the outcome of virally controlled and immunosuppressed PLWH with non-PLWH. Conditional logistic regression and generalised linear models will be employed to analyse the relationship between HIV status and protection durability by adjusting for potential confounders. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of South Carolina (Pro00117583) as a Non-Human Subject study.

Vaccines are considered amongst the most important tools to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As expected, deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection have dropped dramatically with widespread vaccination. However, there are concerns over the duration of vaccine-induced protection, as well as their effectiveness against emerging variants of concern. Here, we constructed a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike of SARS-CoV-2 (AdC68-S). Rapid and high levels of humoral and cellular immune responses were observed after immunization of C57BL/6J mice with one or two doses of AdC68-S. Notably, neutralizing antibodies were observed up to at least six months after vaccination, without substantial decline. Single or double doses AdC68-S immunization resulted in lower viral loads in lungs of mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge both in the short term (21 days) and long-term (6 months). Histopathological examination of AdC68-S immunized mice lungs showed mild histological abnormalities after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, this study demonstrates the efficacy and durability of the AdC68-S vaccine and constitutes a promising candidate for clinical evaluation. © 2022 The Authors","Chimpanzee adenovirus vector; Long-term protection; Neutralizing antibodies; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine","Adenoviridae; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Pan troglodytes; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vaccination; Vaccines, Synthetic; Viral Vaccines; adenovirus vector; neutralizing antibody; virus spike protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; recombinant vaccine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; virus vaccine; Adenoviridae; animal experiment; animal model; antibody detection; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; cellular immunity; chimpanzee; clinical evaluation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytopathogenic effect; HEK293 cell line; histopathology; humoral immunity; immune response; male; mouse; neutralization test; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plaque assay; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ultracentrifugation; variant of concern; Vero C1008 cell line; virus load; Western blotting; animal; C57BL mouse; genetics; Pan troglodytes; prevention and control; vaccination"

After a brief introduction on the global epidemiological and economic implication of the pandemic, the problem of the correct characterization of either vaccine or immunization/herd immunity as global public/common good, according to the necessary characteristics outlined by the pertinent economic theories, is addressed. The conclusion is that the term ""global public good""/global common goods""has been extensively used in the last two years by policy makers, political leaders, academics, economists, international organizations, NGOs and others health groups, in a sort of ""loose way"". Substantially, in order to underscore that equitable access to health products, including vaccines, health and biomedical technologies, medical services, medical devises, whose availability, accessibility, acceptability, affordability to the world is fundamental to tackling the pandemic. The current legal proprietary regime applied to vaccines, extensively covered by IPRs, has transformed an intrinsically non-excludable common/public good (the vaccines, due to their nature and characteristics) in something excludable and rival in consumption. Consequently, the article argues that what is needed is a swift in their legal governance. The current legal discipline of vaccines and health technologies must be changed to bring it into line with the non-excludable nature of these goods. The richest countries in the world, in pursuit of their ""vaccine nationalisms"", have already collectively preordered 8.8 billion doses of vaccine, far in excess of need, thus obliging billions of people in the Global South to wait years to be vaccinated. In this respect, the article investigates the EU vaccines strategy and analyzes the Advanced Purchase Agreements signed by the European Commission with the major vaccine producers, enlightening the untenable secrecy and opacity with which the European Union's executive has handled COVID-19 vaccine supply contracts, and how it has simply paid no more than lip-service to the concept of global common/public good by attributing a broad ""private governance""to the pharmaceutical companies. Then, the various arguments, for and against, the Waiver Proposal to several sections of the WTO TRIPS agreement, introduced by India and South Africa on the TRIPS Council on October 2020, have been briefly summarized, accounting the current luck of needed consensus among the various members of the WTO. The article however describes an important number of new global and collaborative efforts already put in place by a myriad public and private actors to allow efficient development and production of vaccines in order to enhance a global access to vaccines. The article concludes by stressing the major developments in the U.S. patent's landscape and in the Biden Administration's attitude towards the current global health crisis, that leave hope for ""extraordinary measures""to be agreed by the international community in near future. The auspice is that the time has finally arrived for the international community to develop reliable and long term solutions to tackle future global pandemic, preferably by the negotiation of a new WHO global health treaty, to secure universal fair access to essential technologies and vaccines and protecting them as global public/common goods.  © 2021 Nerina Boschiero.","cooperation and solidarity; COVID-19; economic crisis and costs of the pandemic; global common goods; health care products; inequalities; intellectual property rights; management of the commons; vaccines",""

Typically, infectious disease surveillance relies on capturing clinical cases within a healthcare system, classifying cases by etiology and enumerating cases over a period of time. Disease burden is often then extrapolated to the general population. Serology (i.e., examining serum for the presence of pathogen-specific antibodies) has long been used to inform about individuals past exposure and immunity to specific pathogens. However, it has been underutilized as a tool to evaluate the infectious disease burden landscape at the population level and guide public health decisions. In this review, we outline how serology provides a powerful tool to complement case-based surveillance for determining disease burden and epidemiology of infectious diseases, highlighting its benefits and limitations. We describe the current serology-based technologies and illustrate their use with examples from both the pre-and post-COVID-19-pandemic context. In particular, we review the challenges to and opportunities in implementing serological surveillance in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), which bear the brunt of the global infectious disease burden. Finally, we discuss the relevance of serology data for public health decision-making and describe scenarios in which this data could be used, either independently or in conjunction with case-based surveillance. We conclude that public health systems would greatly benefit from the inclusion of serology to supplement and strengthen existing case-based infectious disease surveillance strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

To address this, we explored the SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses to a novel self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine followed by a UK authorised mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) in individuals with and without previous COVID-19, and compared these responses with those who received an authorised vaccine alone. 35 subjects receiving saRNA (saRNA group) as part of the COVAC1 clinical trial and an additional 40 participants receiving an authorised SARS-CoV-2 vaccine only (non-saRNA group) were recruited. Antibody responses were measured by ELISA and a pseudoneutralisation assay for wildtype, Delta and Omicron variants. Cellular responses were measured by IFN-γ ELISpot and an activation induced marker (AIM) assay. Approximately 50% in each group had previous COVID-19 prior to vaccination, confirmed by PCR or antibody positivity on ELISA. All of those who received saRNA subsequently received a full course of an authorised vaccine. The majority (83%) of those receiving saRNA who were COVID-19 naïve at baseline seroconverted following the second dose, and those with previous COVID-19 had an increase in antibody titres two weeks following saRNA vaccination (median 27-fold), however titres were lower when compared to mRNA vaccination. Two weeks following the 2nd authorised mRNA vaccine dose, binding and neutralising antibody titres were significantly higher in the saRNA participants with previous COVID-19, compared to non-saRNA, or COVID-19 naive saRNA participants. Cellular responses were again highest in this group, with a higher proportion of spike specific CD8+ than CD4+ T cells when compared to those receiving the mRNA vaccine only. These findings suggest an immunological benefit of increased antigen exposure, both from natural infection and vaccination, particularly evident in those receiving heterologous vaccination with saRNA and mRNA. © 2022 Elliott et al.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 VBH among a highly educated subset of the German population and to explore the potential demographic, anamnestic, and psychosocial determinants of this problem. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted in December 2021 among German university students and employees to evaluate their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine booster (VB) doses. The study used a self-administered questionnaire that was developed and disseminated digitally, and the questionnaire inquired about participants' demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related anamnesis, COVID-19 vaccine-related anamnesis, and psychosocial predictors of COVID-19 VBH. A total of 930 participants were recruited, of which 608 (65.4%) were students, 682 (73.3%) were females, and their mean age was 29.08 ± 10.93 years. Fifty-five participants (5.9%) had been previously infected by COVID-19 and the vast majority of infections happened before the first vaccine dose. Over 95% of the participants had received at least one vaccine dose, and the most commonly administered vaccine was BNT162b2. The overall COVID-19 VB acceptance was satisfactory (87.8%) and induced by various altruistic promoters, e.g., family health protection, community health protection, and patients' health protection. The students (86.3%), the previously infected participants (76.4%), the participants who did not receive primer doses of COVID-19 vaccines (2.5 %), and those who were hospitalized (40%) and sought medical care/treatment after receiving primer doses (86.8%) were less likely to accept COVID-19 VB compared to the employees (90.7%), the participants who were not previously infected (88.6%) and those who received primer dose (91.7%), and the participants who were not hospitalized (92%) nor sought medical care/treatment after primer doses (92.9%), respectively. The perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 VB against severe illness (adjusted odds ratio “AOR”: 47.65–95% confidence interval “CI”: 23.65–96.49), symptomatic infection (AOR: 9.87–95% CI: 5.20–18.71), community transmission (AOR: 5.34–95% CI: 3.00–9.49) and emerging variants (AOR: 19.12–95% CI: 10.57–34.55) were key predictors for COVID-19 VB acceptance; therefore, it needs to be highlighted in vaccine messaging. In addition, the perceived safety of COVID-19 VB and ethical dilemmas of vaccine justice need to be addressed publicly.

Mass vaccination is the safest and fastest pandemic exit strategy. Mass vaccination clinics are a particularly important tool in quickly achieving herd immunity. Primary care physicians have played a crucial role in organizing and running vaccination clinics. In this special report, we synthesize existing guidelines and peer-reviewed studies to provide physicians with practical guidance on planning and implementing COVID-19 mass vaccination clinics. METHODS PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and Embase were used to search for relevant literature using search terms that included COVID-19, mass vaccination, and best practice. We also identified and analyzed national and international guidelines. RESULTS Forty-six relevant articles, reports, and guidelines were identified and synthesized. Articles included mass vaccination clinic guidelines and studies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key considerations for COVID-19 mass vaccination clinics include leadership and role designation, site selection, clinic layout and workflow, day-to-day operations, infection prevention, and communication strategies. CONCLUSIONS Planning and implementing a successful COVID-19 mass vaccination clinic requires several key considerations. Primary care plays an important role in organizing clinics and ensuring populations made vulnerable by social and economic policies are being reached. Ongoing data collection is required to evaluate and continuously improve COVID-19 mass vaccination efforts. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine rollout occurs in various countries, research will be required to identify the main factors for success to inform future pandemic responses. © 2022, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

The present COVID-19 outbreak has put pressure on the scientific community to develop medications and vaccinations to combat COVID-19. However, according to highly optimistic forecasts, we could not have a COVID-19 vaccine until September 2020. This is due to the fact that a successful COVID-19 vaccine will necessitate a careful validation of effectiveness and adverse reactivity given that the target vaccine population includes high-risk people over 60, particularly those with severe co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare professionals, and those involved in essential industrial sectors. For passive immunization, which is being considered for Covid-19, there are several platforms for vaccine development, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The COVID-19 pandemic, which is arguably the deadliest in the last 100 years after the Spanish flu, necessitates a swift assessment of the various approaches for their ability to incite protective immunity and safety to prevent unintended immune potentiation, which is crucial to the pathogenesis of this virus. Considering the pandemic's high fatality rate and rapid spread, an efficient vaccination is critical for its management. As a result, academia, industry, and government are collaborating in unprecedented ways to create and test a wide range of vaccinations. In this review, we summarize the Covid-19 vaccine development initiatives, recent trends, difficulties, comparison between traditional vaccines development and Covid-19 vaccines development also listed the approved/authorized, phase-3 and pre-clinical trials Covid-19 vaccines in different countries. © 2022","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine; Vaccine development; Virus","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; History, 20th Century; Humans; Influenza Pandemic, 1918-1919; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine Development; DNA vaccine; inactivated vaccine; live vaccine; nucleic acid vaccine; RNA vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; health care personnel; human; mortality rate; pandemic; pathogenesis; Review; Spanish influenza; vaccination; vaccine development; history; pandemic; prevention and control; Spanish influenza"

The only licensed TB vaccine, the one-hundred-year-old Bacille Calmette-Guérin has variable efficacy and often provides poor protection against adult pulmonary TB, the transmissible form of the disease. Thus, the lack of an optimal TB vaccine is one of the key barriers to TB control. Recently, the development of highly efficacious COVID-19 vaccines within one year accelerated the vaccine development process in human use, with the notable example of mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectored vaccines, and increased the public acceptance of the concept of the controlled human challenge model. In the TB vaccine field, recent progress also facilitated the deployment of an effective TB vaccine. In this review, we provide an update on the current virus-vectored TB vaccine pipeline and summarize the latest findings that might facilitate TB vaccine development. In detail, on the one hand, we provide a systematic literature review of the virus-vectored TB vaccines are in clinical trials, and other promising candidate vaccines at an earlier stage of development are being evaluated in preclinical animal models. These research sharply increase the likelihood of finding a more effective TB vaccine in the near future. On the other hand, we provide an update on the latest tools and concept that facilitating TB vaccine research development. We propose that a pre-requisite for successful development may be a better understanding of both the lung-resident memory T cell-mediated mucosal immunity and the trained immunity of phagocytic cells. Such knowledge could reveal novel targets and result in the innovative vaccine designs that may be needed for a quantum leap forward in vaccine efficacy. We also summarized the research on controlled human infection and ultra-low-dose aerosol infection murine models, which may provide more realistic assessments of vaccine utility at earlier stages. In addition, we believe that the success in the ongoing efforts to identify correlates of protection would be a game-changer for streamlining the triage of multiple next-generation TB vaccine candidates. Thus, with more advanced knowledge of TB vaccine research, we remain hopeful that a more effective TB vaccine will eventually be developed in the near future.

The data available so far show that newborns and young children do not develop severe forms of COVID-19, but a small proportion of them will still need hospitalization. Even though young children represent an important vector of the infection, vaccination at such a young age was not yet considered. Thus, the question of whether potentially protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be provided to them via breast milk or across the placenta, as “passive immunity”, still stands. Materials and Methods: Between January–July 2021, we have conducted a prospective study that aimed to measure the immunoglob-ulin (Ig) A and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers in the breast milk of 28 vaccinated lactating mothers, sampled at 30 and 60 days after the second dose of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. Anti-RBD reactive IgA and IgG antibodies were detected and quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Anti-RBD IgA and IgG were present in all breast milk samples, both in the first and in the second specimens, without a significant difference between those two. The anti-RBD IgA titers were approximately five-times higher than the anti-RBD IgG ones. The anti-RBD IgA and IgG titers were correlated with the infants’ age, but they were not correlated with the vaccine type or mother’s age. The anti-RBD IgA excreted in milk were inversely correlated with the parity number. Conclusions: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG can be found in the milk secretion of mothers vaccinated with mRNA vaccines and, presumably, these antibodies should offer protection to the newborn, considering that the antibodies’ titers did not decrease after 60 days. The antibody response is directly proportional to the breastfed child’s age, but the amount of anti-RBD IgA decreases with the baby’s rank. The antibody response did not depend on the vaccine type, or on the mother’s age. © 2022 by the authors.

Our aim is to estimate the health impact of COVID-19 vaccination alongside benefit-risk assessment of different dosing intervals in 13 middle-income countries (MICs) of Europe. Methods: We fitted a dynamic transmission model to country-level daily reported COVID-19 mortality in 13 MICs in Europe (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Serbia, North Macedonia, Turkey, and Ukraine). A vaccine product with characteristics similar to those of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 (AZD1222) vaccine was used in the base case scenario and was complemented by sensitivity analyses around efficacies similar to other COVID-19 vaccines. Both fixed dosing intervals at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks and dose-specific intervals that prioritise specific doses for certain age groups were tested. Optimal intervals minimise COVID-19 mortality between March 2021 and December 2022. We incorporated the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) into the model and conducted a benefit-risk assessment to quantify the tradeoff between health benefits versus adverse events following immunisation. Findings: In all countries modelled, optimal strategies are those that prioritise the first doses among older adults (60+ years) or adults (20+ years), which lead to dosing intervals longer than six months. In comparison, a four-week fixed dosing interval may incur 10.1% [range: 4.3% - 19.0%; n = 13 (countries)] more deaths. The rapid waning of the immunity induced by the first dose (i.e. with means ranging 60-120 days as opposed to 360 days in the base case) resulted in shorter optimal dosing intervals of 8-20 weeks. Benefit-risk ratios were the highest for fixed dosing intervals of 8-12 weeks. Interpretation: We infer that longer dosing intervals of over six months could reduce COVID-19 mortality in MICs of Europe. Certain parameters, such as rapid waning of first-dose induced immunity and increased immune escape through the emergence of VOCs, could significantly shorten the optimal dosing intervals.

We estimated 1-and 2-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Quebec, Canada, including protection against varying outcome severity, variants of concern (VOCs), and the stability of single-dose protection up to 16 weeks postvaccination. Methods: A test-negative design compared vaccination among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and weekly matched (10:1), randomly sampled, test-negative HCWs using linked surveillance and immunization databases. Vaccine status was defined by 1 dose ≥14 days or 2 doses ≥7 days before illness onset or specimen collection. Adjusted VE was estimated by conditional logistic regression. Results: Primary analysis included 5316 cases and 53 160 controls. Single-dose VE was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68%-73%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection; 73% (95% CI, 71%-75%) against illness; and 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%) against hospitalization. Two-dose VE was 86% (95% CI, 81%-90%) and 93% (95% CI, 89%-95%), respectively, with no hospitalizations. VE was higher for non-VOCs than VOCs (73% Alpha) among single-dose recipients but not 2-dose recipients. Across 16 weeks, no decline in single-dose VE was observed, with appropriate stratification based upon prioritized vaccination determined by higher vs lower likelihood of direct patient contact. Conclusions: One mRNA vaccine dose provided substantial and sustained protection to HCWs extending at least 4 months postvaccination. In circumstances of vaccine shortage, delaying the second dose may be a pertinent public health strategy.  © 2021 The Author(s).","COVID-19; healthcare workers; SARS-CoV-2; test-negative design; vaccine effectiveness","Canada; COVID-19; Health Personnel; Humans; mRNA Vaccines; Quebec; RNA, Messenger; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines, Synthetic; bnt 162b 2; elasomeran; mrna 1273vaccine; RNA vaccine; tozinameran; messenger RNA; recombinant vaccine; RNA vaccine; administrative personnel; adult; aged; Article; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; data base; disease surveillance; female; follow up; groups by age; health care personnel; hospitalization; human; immunity; immunization; laboratory personnel; major clinical study; male; nurse; nursing assistant; paramedical personnel; public health; Quebec; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; single drug dose; social worker; vaccination; variant of concern; Canada; epidemiology; health care personnel; prevention and control; Quebec"

It is urgent to understand the current immune status of various Chinese populations given that the preexisting immunity has been established by national vaccination or exposure to past variants. Using sera from 85 individuals (including 21 convalescents of natural infection, 15 cases which suffered a breakthrough infection after being fully vaccinated, and 49 healthy vaccinees), we showed significantly enhanced neutralizing activities against SRAS-CoV-2 variants in convalescent sera, especially those who had been fully vaccinated. The neutralizing antibodies against Omicron were detectable in 75% of convalescents and 44.9% of healthy vaccinees (p = 0:006), with a GMT of 289.5, 180.9-463.3, and 42.6, 31.3-59, respectively. However, the neutralizing activities were weaker in young convalescents (aged < 18 y), with a detectable rate of 50% and a GMT of 46.4 against Omicron. We also examined and found no pan-sarbecovirus neutralizing activities in vaccinated SARSCoV- 1 survivors. A booster dose could further increase the breadth and magnitude of neutralization against WT and variants of concern (VOCs) to different degrees. In addition, we showed that COVID-19-inactivated vaccines can elicit Omicronspecific T-cell responses. The positive rates of ELISpot reactions were 26.7% (4/15) and 43.8% (7/16) in the full vaccination group and the booster vaccination group, respectively, although without statistically significant difference. The neutralizing antibody titers declined while T-cell responses remain consistent over 6 months. These findings will inform the optimization of public health vaccination and intervention strategies to protect diverse populations against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Advances. Breakthrough infection significantly boosted neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants as compared to booster immunization with inactivated vaccine. Vaccine-induced virus-specific T-cell immunity, on the other hand, may compensate for the shortfall. Furthermore, the public health system should target the most vulnerable group due to a poorer protective serological response in both infected and vaccinated adolescents. © 2022 American Association for the Advancement of Science.","","Antibodies; Coronavirus; T-cells; 'current; Antibody titers; Cellulars; Control strategies; Immune response; Natural infection; Neutralisation; Neutralizing antibodies; Statistically significant difference; T-cell response; Vaccines"

However, the increasing number of people with no immunity to poxvirus because of the end of the smallpox vaccination programme has created a vulnerable population for the monkeypox outbreak. On 23 July 2022, it was announced that the World Health Organization’s director-general has determined that the multicountry outbreak of monkeypox constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The monkeypox virus is an orthopoxvirus that causes a disease with symptoms similar to smallpox but less severe. Many unanswered questions remain regarding monkeypox’s pathogenesis, transmission and host reservoir. There is currently no evidence that transmission by individuals can sustain zoonotic infections during human-to-human transmissions; the continued emergence of these pathogens highlights the interconnectedness of animals and humans. The increasing number of monkeypox cases outside the endemic region has highlighted the need for effective global capacity building to prevent the spread of the disease and its impact on global health security. The priority now is to stop the spread of the disease and protect frontline healthcare workers and the most vulnerable individuals. This article aims to comprehensively analyse the various aspects of the transmission and epidemiology of monkeypox. It also explores possible diagnostic techniques, therapeutics and prevention strategies. A key recommendation is that primary care and public health professionals are expected to increase their efforts to be vigilant and contain any potential outbreaks. © 2022. The Authors.

Presently, the Omicron variant has spread very rapidly worldwide within a short time period. As the most mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron has instilled serious uncertainties on the effectiveness of humoral adaptive immunity generated by COVID-19 vaccination or an active viral infection as well as the protection provided by antibody-based immunotherapies. Amidst such high public health concerns, the need to carry out booster vaccination has been emphasized. Current evidence reveals the importance of incorporating booster vaccination using several vaccine platforms, such as viral vector- and mRNA-based vaccines, as well as other platforms that are under explorative investigations. Further research is being conducted to assess the effectiveness and durability of protection provided by booster COVID-19 vaccination against Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants. © 2022 Government College of Engineering.

To halt the pandemic and alleviate its impact on society, economy, and public health, the development of vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 was a dire need. To date, various platforms have been utilized for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, and over 200 vaccine candidates have been produced, many of which have obtained the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for emergency use. Despite this successful development and licensure, concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of these vaccines have arisen, given the unprecedented speed of vaccine development and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains and variants.

The objectives were to quantify anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in vaccinated individuals and to determine clinical and pathological factors associated with that response. Samples were taken at least 21 days after the second vaccine dose. The mean age was 45 years (ES 0.44), 71.1% were women and20.7% (n = 137) reported previous COVID-19 infection. IgG anti-spike (S) 1 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 99.7% (n = 658) of the participants. The mean titer was 4197 ± 263.87 AU / ml (95 CI: 3679.1, 4715.3). The antibody response was higher in the group with priorCOVID-19 disease vs. the group with no previous infection (10 693 ± 846.22 AU / ml vs. 2495.8 ± 187.98 AU / ml, p < 0.0001 in t-test). In a subgroup of 21 participants with high titers of anti-S1 IgG antibodies and with no apparent previous COVID-19, 11 individuals were positive for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. It is concluded that most of the vaccinated health workers developed antibodies and that those who had the disease prior to vaccination had higher antibody titers than those who did not have the disease. © 2021, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas.

Despite this, the vaccination rate in pregnant women is low in Italy. The COVID-19 pandemic has focused the attention of public opinion on communicable diseases, underlining the importance of primary prevention measures such as vaccination. We conducted a survey to investigate the behavior of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding maternal immunization to identify the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in order to overcome them. The new challenge is COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, and preliminary data show hesitancy towards it. Our analysis may be useful to improve immunization in the pregnant population, including through the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A targeted survey was performed in Italy including 520 women who experienced in the first trimester of pregnancy, prior to the novel coronavirus spread, the 2019– 2020 influenza vaccination campaign and the Tdap vaccine recommendation in the third trimester during the COVID pandemic. They represent a unique model to investigate if the new coronavirus outbreak might have changed attitudes towards vaccination in pregnancy in the same patients. Data were collected from a self-completed paper questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were calculated and percentages were compared using the chi-2 test or Fisher’s exact test. Results: We obtained data from 195 of the 520 women who gave birth during the inclusion period; 325 cases declined to participate in the survey. A total of 8.7% (17 cases) performed flu vaccination in the first trimester of pregnancy (pre-COVID era), 50.8% (99 cases) accepted Tdap immunization during their third trimester of gestation (COVID-19 pandemic) and 6.7% (13 cases) received both vaccines during pregnancy. For both the flu and Tdap shots, pregnant patients were more likely to accept the vaccines if they were recommended by a healthcare provider, whereas the main reason not to be vaccinated was the lack of such a recommendation. Conclusions: Our survey shows that the COVID-19 experience, which has raised awareness as to the role of vaccines in preventable diseases, may positively change attitudes toward immunization in pregnancy. Vaccination must be recommended to all pregnant women and organized during routine prenatal care as an important element for the prevention of communicable diseases. Vaccination hesitancy can be minimized through consistent recommendation to all pregnant women offered by obstetric staff during routine prenatal care. This approach is likely to be effective in terms of building trust in flu and Tdpa immunization among pregnant women, as well as to avoid unjustified hesitancy towards the more recent COVID-19 vaccines. © 2021 by the authors.

We benchmarked serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NPs in non-human primates against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (HexaPro) using a panel of circulating mutants. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are similarly resilient to many RBD residue substitutions tested, although mutations at and surrounding position 484 have negative consequences for neutralization. Mosaic and cocktail nanoparticle immunogens displaying multiple sarbecovirus RBDs elicit broad neutralizing activity in mice and protect mice against SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine. This study provides proof of principle that multivalent sarbecovirus RBD-NPs induce heterotypic protection and motivates advancing such broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines to the clinic. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; mosaic nanoparticle; receptor-binding domain; sarbecovirus; SARS-CoV-2; self-assembling nanoparticle; spike glycoprotein; vaccine design",""

This study aimed to detect the safety and efficacy of vaccines among the Egyptian population. Methodology and Results: Data was collected using an online survey from participants who took two doses of the BBIBP-CorV, ChAdOx1, or BNT162 vaccines. Pain at the vaccine injection site, muscle pain, fatigue, dizziness, fever, and headache were the most common side effects after the first and second doses. The number pf side effects was higher in ChAdOx1 than in BNT162 and BBIBP-CorV. Most of the side effects started on the first day after vaccination and per-sisted for 1–2 days. Vaccinated people with past coronavirus infections before vaccination developed better antibodies than those who were only vaccinated. The side-effect severity was greater after the first dose of BBIBP-CorV and ChAdOx1 than after the second dose, but in contrast, the side-effect severity was greater after the second dose of BNT162 vaccine than after the first dose. ChAdOx1 was more effective than BBIBP-CorV, and one dose of ChAdOx1 produced an immune response similar to that of two doses of BBIBP-CorV. Conclusions: Coronavirus vaccines were well-tolerated, safe, and produced an immune response against the virus in most cases. Most postvaccine side effects were mild to moderate, which indicated the building of immunity by the body for protection. © 2022 by the authors.

Objective: To evaluate determinants of seroprevalence and changes in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies longitudinally in adults with different levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (defined a priori as low, medium, and high based on presumed occupational risk), in two Andean cities in Ecuador. Methods: Longitudinal cohort study of 1,000 adults aged 18 years and older with questionnaire data and sample collection done at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months during the period 2020-2023. Observations collected included WHO-ISARIC questionnaire and peripheral blood and saliva samples for measurement of IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively.  Planned analyses are tailored to the longitudinal nature of the outcomes defined by participants’ antibody levels and aim at estimating their average trends with time since infection in each of the occupational groups, adjusted for demographics and calendar-time levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population. The latter reflect the impact of the national control measures such as vaccinations and movement restrictions. Importance: Understanding the duration and the dynamics of waning immunity to SARS-CoV-2, in the context of exposures to emerging virus variants and immunization, will inform the implementation of targeted public health strategies in the Latin American region. Ethics and Dissemination: This study will observe the bioethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent will be obtained. Samples from participants will be stored for up to three years after which they will be destroyed. The study protocol was approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health Ethics Committee for COVID-19 Research. Antibody results will be provided to participants and participating institutions and to the national health authorities.

However, challenges exist to deploying these vaccines, especially in resource-limited sub-Saharan Africa. In this article, we highlight lessons learned from previous efforts to scale up vaccine distribution and offer considerations for policymakers and key stakeholders to use for successful COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Africa. These considerations range from improving weak infrastructure for managing data and identifying adverse events after immunization to considering financing options for overcoming the logistical challenges of vaccination campaigns and generating demand for vaccine uptake. In addition, providing COVID-19 vaccination can be used to promote the adoption of universal healthcare, especially in sub-Saharan Africa countries. © 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is considered a global threat to public health that undermines the efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter and other social media platforms allow people to exchange information and express concerns and emotions on COVID-19-related issues. This research aims to understand people's sentiment on COVID-19 vaccines from data collected from Twitter. Analyzing the public attitude toward the vaccines helps the authorities to make better decisions and reach the intended herd immunity. In this paper, we utilize the state-of-the-art transformer-based classification models, RoBERTa and BERT, along with multiple task-specific versions, to classify people's opinions about COVID-19 vaccinations into positive, negative, and neutral. A Twitter dataset that consists of people's opinions about vaccines is used to train and evaluate the presented models. Two ensemble learning techniques that aggregate the individual classifiers are presented for further performance improvement: majority voting and stacking with Support Vector Machine (SVM) as meta-learner. The results also show that applying ensemble learning significantly outperforms the individual classifiers using all evaluation measures. We also found that ensembling with stacking has an advantage over simple majority voting.  © 2022 IEEE.","BERT; COVID-19; deep learning; ensemble learning; RoBERTa; Sentiment Analysis; vaccine hesitancy","Deep learning; Health risks; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Vaccines; BERT; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Global threats; Individual classifiers; RoBERTa; Sentiment analysis; Stackings; Vaccine hesitancy; COVID-19"

Many vaccines are already being mass produced and supplied in many countries. However, the COVID-19 vaccination programme will be the biggest in history. Reaching herd immunity will require an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that will take several months and millions of dollars. Using different network models, COVID-19 pandemic dynamics of different countries can be recapitulated such as in Italy. Stochastic computational simulations highlight that peak epidemic sizes in a population strongly depend on the network structure. Assuming a vaccine efficacy of at least 80% in a mass vaccination program, at least 70% of a given population should be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity, independently of the network structure. If the vaccine efficacy reports lower levels of efficacy in practice, then the coverage of vaccination would be needed to be even higher. Simulations suggest that the “Ring of Vaccination” strategy, vaccinating susceptible contact and contact of contacts, would prevent new waves of COVID −19 meanwhile a high percent of the population is vaccinated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Epidemics; Mass vaccination; Networks; Ring of Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunity, Herd; Mass Vaccination; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; Italy; SARS coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; COVID-19; epidemic; immunity; public health; severe acute respiratory syndrome; strategic approach; vaccination; vaccine; Article; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; herd immunity; human; Italy; mathematical model; pandemic; population research; public health; vaccination; herd immunity; mass immunization"

Building confidence is crucial for better preparedness of future pandemics. Following the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy in the country, the aim of this study was to examine whether the Saudi public feels relieved post-vaccination and to identify the factors predicting such relief. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in July 2021 among COVID-19 vaccine recipients in Saudi Arabia. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to examine and identify the variables associated with feeling relieved post-vaccination. Results: Most of the respondents (66%) stated feeling more relieved post-vaccination. Male gender [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.380; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.981–1.943], being a student (AOR: 3.902; 95% CI: 1.674–9.096), and received two doses of the vaccine (AOR: 2.278; 95% CI: 1.630–3.182) were associated with feeling more relieved after getting vaccinated. Respondents who were anxious about the vaccine before receiving it (AOR: 0.220; 95% CI: 0.160–0.302), and experienced a severe reaction after vaccination (AOR: 0.288; 95% CI: 0.165–0.504) had lower odds of feeling relieved post-vaccination. Respondents who relied on social media as the main source of vaccine-related information and those having no information about the vaccine were also less likely to feel relieved post-vaccination. Conclusions: Individuals' attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines may not necessarily alter post-vaccination. Although mandatory vaccination policies can significantly contribute to achieving herd immunity, public confidence toward vaccines might be eroded, which could in turn impose significant challenges in future pandemics efforts.

Most SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) and some the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which is the major antigen of SARS-CoV-2. While the antibody response to RBD has been extensively characterized, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the NTD protein are less well studied. Using 227 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NTD-specific antibodies could be induced during infection. As compared to the results of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the serological response of SARS-CoV-2 NTD is less cross-reactive with SARS-CoV, a pandemic strain that was identified in 2003. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an altered antigenicity when expressed alone. Overall, our results suggest that while NTD offers a supplementary strategy for serology testing, it may not be suitable as an immunogen for vaccine development. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","COVID-19; immunogen; N-terminal domain; NTD; SARS-CoV-2; serology","Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Cell Line; Chlorocebus aethiops; COVID-19; Cross Reactions; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Pandemics; Protein Binding; Protein Domains; SARS-CoV-2; Sf9 Cells; Vero Cells; neutralizing antibody; protein binding; virus antibody; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigenicity; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; humoral immunity; immunization; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cell line; Chlorocebus aethiops; immunology; pandemic; protein domain; Sf9 cell line; Vero cell line"

Presently, the populace is largely susceptible as only a small percentage is vaccinated, and their immunity is likely to have waned. And when the disease re-emerges, the susceptible individuals may be manipulated by disinformation on Social Media to refuse vaccines. Thus, a combination of countermeasures consisting of antiviral drugs and vaccines and a range of policies for their application need to be investigated. Opinions regarding whether to receive vaccines evolve over time through social exchanges via networks that overlap with but are not identical to the disease propagation networks. These couple the spread of the biological and information contagion and necessitate a joint investigation of the two. Methods We develop a computationally tractable metapopulation epidemiological model that captures the joint spatio-temporal evolution of an infectious disease (e.g., smallpox, COVID-19) and opinion dynamics. Results Considering smallpox, the computations based on the model show that opinion dynamics have a substantial impact on the fatality count. Towards understanding how perpetrators are likely to seed the infection, we identify a) the initial distribution of infected individuals that maximize the overall fatality count; and b) which habitation structures are more vulnerable to outbreaks. We assess the relative efficacy of different countermeasures and conclude that a combination of vaccines and drugs minimize the fatalities, and by itself, drugs reduce fatalities more than the vaccine. Accordingly, we assess the impact of increase in the supply of drugs and identify the most effective among a collection of policies for administering of drugs for various parameter combinations. Many of the observed patterns are stable to variations of a diverse set of parameters. Conclusions Our findings provide a quantitative foundation for various important elements of public health discourse that have largely been conducted qualitatively.  © 2021 Ali et al.

To date, over a hundred COVID-19 vaccines are known to be under development, and the few that have been approved to fight the disease are using the spike protein as the primary target antigen. Although virus-neutralizing epitopes are mainly located within the RBD of the spike protein, the presence of T cell epitopes, particularly the CTL epitopes that are likely to be needed for killing infected cells, has received comparatively little attention. This study predicted several potential T cell epitopes with web-based analytic tools and narrowed them down from several potential MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes by ELIspot and cytolytic assays to a conserved MHC-I epitope. The epitope is highly conserved in current viral variants and compatible with a presentation by most HLA alleles worldwide. In conclusion, we identified a CTL epitope suitable for evaluating the CD8+ T cell-mediated cellular response and potentially for addition into future COVID-19 vaccine candidates to maximize CTL responses against SARS-CoV-2. © 2022 The Author(s).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging outbreak and spreading rapidly across the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic of unprecedented proportions has devastated almost all countries and pervaded globally. However, various vaccines have been developed to achieve immunity against the virus and limit transmissibility. By 18 November 2021, 52.6% of the world population got first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. South Asia shares 15% fully vaccinated and 22.6% partially vaccinated population in the world. The 56.5% of South Asian Association Regional Cooperation (SAARC) regions, consisting of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, and Bhutan, got the first shot of COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 30.5% were fully vaccinated. India has the highest percentage of the vaccinated population of about 46.5% among SAARC countries. Although South Asian countries have unstable multiple socio-economic factors, including poverty, overpopulation, low literacy about medical care and medical systems, etc., the increasing trend in vaccination status has been observed. The high percentage of health budgets of SAARC countries was utilized for purchasing COVID-19 vaccines.

The significance of the chickenpox (CP) problem for public health and economy of Russia necessitated inclusion of CP vaccination in the regional immunization programs of some regions of the Russian Federation and in the vaccination schedule as an epidemic-response measure. The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of CP vaccination to provide the rationale for recommendations on expansion of the national preventive vaccination schedule. Materials and methods. The vaccination effectiveness was assessed by comparison of the vaccination rates and CP incidence rates in 2006–2021 with the reference to the data collected from forms No. 2 and No. 5 of the National Statistical Monitoring in Russia and in its regions. Results and discussion. Before 2019, in some regions of Russia, CP vaccination of children within regional immunization programs and vaccination of risk groups within the vaccination schedule following the epidemic-response measures had hardly any effect on the epidemiological situation. The remote-work and stay-at-home policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 resulted in a decrease in the incidence and an increased number of individuals who did not have immunity against Varicella zoster, thus subsequently leading to the increased CP incidence in the country. However, the Central, Volga, and Siberian Federal Districts were able to avoid an increase in the CP incidence due to the significantly increased vaccination coverage among children in 2020– 2021. At the same time, in most of the regions, less than 2% of children aged 1–6 years were vaccinated annually. The insufficient CP vaccination coverage in the regions having extensive experience of planned immunization of children led to the shift of the incidence towards older age groups and increased risk of development of congenital infection. Conclusion. To increase the effectiveness of CP preventive vaccination, it is recommended that the national vaccination schedule should include two-dose vaccination with the coverage of at least 90% of one-year-old children, while continuing immunization of older age individuals from the groups that are at risk of infection. © 2022, Central Research Institute for Epidemiology.

Purpose: The study aimed to examine the associations between the intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 and the people’s trust in the government, and compare both concepts based on the subject’s characteristics. Methods: This is a part of a large-scale cross-sectional study that employed a web-based survey conducted in 2021. The study utilized data collected on the main study variables using questionnaires from a convenient sample of 281 Jordanian subjects. Bivariate statistics were employed with .05 as a significance level. Results: Trust in the government scores were significantly different based on gender and marital status. As mistrust in the government increases, subjects tend to accept the vaccine. Female subjects tend to trust the government but have low intention to get vaccinated than male subjects. Married subjects tend to have higher mistrust of the government than single subjects. Subjects who agree with the statement “herd immunity would be beneficial for COVID-19 and this fact is covered up” and ""the government restrictions are stronger than is needed"" had a higher intention to get vaccinated scores than those who disagree with it. Conclusions: To build and maintain the trust of the public, the government needs to enhance its efforts in publicizing information on the pandemic and employ strategies for improved communication management to the public through social media and mainstream information sources and healthcare providers, especially those who are in the front lines healthcare providers. Policy-makers should employ strategies to improve communication management to the public and rebuild trust in the government during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Effective vaccines for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus exist; however, vaccination rates among EMS professionals remain largely unknown. Consequently, we sought to document vaccination rates of EMS professionals and identify predictors of vaccination uptake. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of North Carolina EMS professionals after the COVID-19 vaccines were widely available. The survey assessed vaccination status as well as beliefs regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccine effectiveness. Prediction of vaccine uptake was modeled using logistic regression. Results: A total of 860 EMS professionals completed the survey, of whom 74.7% reported receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. Most respondents believed that COVID-19 is a serious threat to the population, that they are personally at higher risk of infection, that vaccine side effects are outweighed by illness prevention, and the vaccine is safe and effective. Despite this, only 18.7% supported mandatory vaccination for EMS professionals. Statistically significant differences were observed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness, recall of employer vaccine recommendation, perceived risk of infection, degree of threat to the population, and trust in government to take actions to limit the spread of disease. Unvaccinated respondents cited reasons such as belief in personal health and natural immunity as protectors against infection, concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness, inadequate vaccine knowledge, and lack of an employer mandate for declining the vaccine. Predictors of vaccination included belief in vaccine safety (odds ratio [OR] 5.5, P=<0.001) and effectiveness (OR 4.6, P=<0.001); importance of vaccination to protect patients (OR 15.5, P=<0.001); perceived personal risk of infection (OR 1.8, P=0.04); previous receipt of influenza vaccine (OR 2.5, P=0.003); and sufficient knowledge to make an informed decision about vaccination (OR 2.4, P=0.024). Conclusion: In this survey of EMS professionals, over a quarter remained unvaccinated for COVID-19. Given the identified predictors of vaccine acceptance, EMS systems should focus on countering misinformation through employee educational campaigns as well as on developing policies regarding workforce immunization requirements. © 2022 Hubble et al.","","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Vaccination; influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; influenza vaccine; adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disease burden; drug safety; employee; female; government; health belief; Health Belief Model; health care policy; health care survey; health workforce; human; immunization; infection risk; innate immunity; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; misinformation; North Carolina; public health campaign; rescue personnel; risk benefit analysis; risk perception; side effect; statistically significant result; trust; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; adverse event; emergency health service; influenza; prevention and control; vaccination"

The anti-S1 antibody levels and specific T cells were measured at two and six months after vaccination. 24.4% of NHR had a previous infection prior to vaccination. The remaining NHR were included in the full vaccination assessment group (FVA). After two months, a 94.9% of the FVA presented anti-S1 antibodies, whereas those seronegative without specific cellular response were 2.54%. At long-term, the frequency of NHR within the FVA group with anti-S1 antibodies at six months were 88.12% and the seronegative subjects without specific cellular response was 8.07%. The cellular immune assays complement the humoral test in the immune vaccine response assessment. Therefore, the cellular immune assessment in NHRs allows for the fine tuning of those seronegative subjects with potential competent immune responses against the vaccine. © 2021 by the authors.

The high transmission rate and the emergence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants demand rapid and effective approaches to preventing the spread, diagnosing on time, and treating affected people. Several COVID-19 vaccines are being developed using different production systems, including plants, which promises the production of cheap, safe, stable, and effective vaccines. The potential of a plant-based system for rapid production at a commercial scale and for a quick response to an infectious disease outbreak has been demonstrated by the marketing of carrot-cell-produced taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) for Gaucher disease and tobacco-produced monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp) for the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Currently, two plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates, coronavirus virus-like particle (CoVLP) and Kentucky Bioprocessing (KBP)-201, are in clinical trials, and many more are in the preclinical stage. Interim phase 2 clinical trial results have revealed the high safety and efficacy of the CoVLP vaccine, with 10 times more neutralizing antibody responses compared to those present in a convalescent patient’s plasma. The clinical trial of the CoVLP vaccine could be concluded by the end of 2021, and the vaccine could be available for public immunization thereafter. This review encapsulates the efforts made in plant-based COVID-19 vaccine development, the strategies and technologies implemented, and the progress accomplished in clinical trials and preclinical studies so far. © 2021 by the authors.

Given emerging vaccines, the aim of this study was to provide simple methods for estimating the hidden prevalence of asymptomatic cases and levels of herd immunity to aid future immunization policy and planning. We applied the method in Ireland. Methods: For large scale epidemics, indirect models for estimating prevalence have been developed. One such method is the benchmark multiplier method. A further method is back-calculation, which has been used successfully to produce estimates of the scale of a HIV infected population. The methods were applied from March to October 2020 and are applicable globally. Results: Results demonstrated that the number of infected individuals was at least twice and possibly six times the number identified through testing. Our estimates ranged from ∼100 000 to 375 000 cases giving a ratio of 1-6 hidden cases for every known case within the study time frame. While both methods are subject to assumptions and limitations, it was interesting to observe that estimates corroborated government statements noting that 80% of people testing positive were asymptomatic. Conclusions: As Europe has now endured several epidemic waves with the emergence globally of new variants, it essential that both policy makers and the public are aware of the scale of the hidden epidemic that may surround them. The need for social distancing is as important as ever as we await global immunization rollout. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

With the intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic, the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs against the etiological agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is also widespread. To prove the effectiveness and safety of these preventive vaccines and therapeutic drugs, available animal models that faithfully recapitulate clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Currently, animal models including mice, golden hamsters, ferrets, nonhuman primates, and other susceptible animals have been involved in the study of COVID-19. Moreover, 117 vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials after the primary evaluation in animal models, of which inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus-vectored vaccines, and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines are promising vaccine candidates. In this review, we summarize the landscape of animal models for COVID-19 vaccine evaluation and advanced vaccines with an efficacy range from about 50% to more than 95%.

We analyzed longitudinal humoral responses against the D614G strain and variants of concern for SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-naive and previously infected individuals who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with sixteen weeks between doses. While administering a second dose to previously infected individuals did not significantly improve humoral responses, these responses significantly increased in naive individuals after a 16-week spaced second dose, achieving similar levels as in previously infected individuals. Comparing these responses to those elicited in individuals receiving a short (4-week) dose interval showed that a 16-week interval induced more robust responses among naive vaccinees.

As a major platform for access to information, social media plays an important role in disseminating health information. This study aimed to evaluate hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccine booster shots in China, assess its association with social media use, and provide information to manage social media. We conducted a cross-sectional study across all 31 provinces in mainland China from November 12, 2021, to November 17, 2021. In total, 3,119 of 3,242 participants completed the questionnaire (response rate = 96.2%). COVID-19 vaccine booster shot hesitancy rate in China was 6.5% (95% CI: 5.6–7.3). Unemployment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.428, 95% CI: 1.590–3.670), low monthly income (aOR 2.854,95% CI: 1.561–5.281), low scores of knowledge (aOR 0.917, 95% CI: 0.869–0.968) and low level of cues to action (aOR 0.773, 95% CI: 0.689–0.869) were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Compared with public social media, lower vaccine hesitancy was associated with high perceived importance of social media (aOR 0.252, 95% CI: 0.146–0.445) and official social media use (aOR 0.671, 95% CI: 0.467–0.954), while higher vaccine hesitancy was associated with traditional media use (aOR 3.718, 95% CI: 1.282–10.273).

This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitancy (VBH) among Czech healthcare workers to explore the potential determinants of VBH. A national cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out between 3 and 11 November 2021, using an online self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) that explored the participants’ demographic characteristics, COVID-19 infection and vaccine anamneses, willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine BD, and the psychosocial drivers of VBH. A total of 3454 HCW properly responded to the online SAQ, of which 80.9% were females, 30.3% were medical professionals, and 50.5% were ≤47 years old. Most of the participants were already inoculated against SARS-CoV-2 (95.2%), and BTN162b2 was the most commonly administered vaccine (90.7%). As the study sample was planned to represent the target population, it revealed a high level of BD acceptance (71.3%) among Czech HCW, while 12.2% were still hesitant and 16.6% were against the currently available BD. These results are consistent with other recent results from central Europe. Medical professional, male, and older participants were more likely to accept BD rather than allied health professional, female, and younger participants. The BDs’ perceived effectiveness against severe illness, symptomatic infection, and community transmission was a significant and strong predictor for BD acceptance, while the effectiveness against the circulating variants was not that important for our target population. The BDs’ perceived safety and ethical dilemmas of vaccine justice should be addressed sufficiently while communicating with HCW and other population groups. The altruistic reasons for BD acceptance, i.e., family protection, patient protection, and community health protection, underpin the recommendation of postponing the COVID-19 vaccine mandating in favour of stressing these altruistic concerns amid public health messaging. © 2021 by the authors.

Underlying this dilemma, lies the problem of the ethical models on which the political decisions of governments in matters of health are based. The article proposes and argues the need to base health policy decisions on an ethical «first person» model, based on responsibility, that allows us to move from a normative ethic to an ethic of responsible behavior.

The current measles vaccination schedule has the first dose given at 9–12 months of age and the second dose given at 15–18 months of age. Measles outbreaks have been associated with an increase in severe RSV infections in children younger than 6 months, probably as a result of measles-induced immunosuppression. A resurgence in measles cases was already occurring before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected global immunisation programmes, resulting in millions of children, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), missing out on their measles vaccine. This will leave many children living in the most vulnerable of circumstances highly susceptible to measles and RSV infections when current COVID-19 public health control measures are lifted. This Viewpoint discusses these issues and highlights the need for urgent action to address this looming crisis. The use of early measles vaccination at 4 months of age could be an effective strategy to prevent severe morbidity and death from both measles and RSV infections in many LMICs. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study predicts uptake rates for different COVID-19 vaccine specifications and identifies personal characteristics that moderate an individual's responsiveness to vaccine attributes. Methods: We developed an online survey with contingent specifications of a COVID-19 vaccine, varying in effectiveness, risks of side effects, duration of immunity, and out-of-pocket cost. Using population-averaged logit models, we estimated vaccine uptake rates that account for uncertainty, heterogeneity across respondents, and interactions between vaccine and personal characteristics. Results: We obtained 3047 completed surveys. The highest uptake rate for an annual vaccine, 62%, is predicted when vaccine effectiveness is 80% to 90%, side effects are minimal, and the vaccine is provided at zero cost, with decreases seen in the uptake rate for less effective vaccines, for example, 50% for 50% to 60% effectiveness. Moreover, we found that Americans’ response to vaccine effectiveness depends on their self-reported concern, that is, concerned respondents report a higher willingness to get vaccinated. Our findings also indicate that COVID-19 vaccine uptake rates decrease with vaccine cost and that responsiveness to vaccine cost is moderated by income. Conclusions: Although providing the COVID-19 vaccine at zero cost will motivate many individuals to get vaccinated, a policy focused exclusively on vaccine cost may not be enough to reach herd immunity thresholds. Although those concerned with COVID-19 will participate, further evidence is needed on how to incentivize participation among the unconcerned (43%) to prevent further pandemic spread. © 2021 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research","contingent scenarios; preference heterogeneity; vaccine uptake","Anti-Vaccination Movement; COVID-19; Humans; Immunization Programs; Intention; Motivation; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; clinical effectiveness; coronavirus disease 2019; econometric model; female; health care policy; health survey; herd immunity threshold; human; immunization; major clinical study; male; middle aged; self report; virus immunity; anti-vaccination movement; behavior; drug therapy; motivation; prevention and control; preventive health service; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; United States"

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), as well as pseudovirus neutralization test (PVNT) were per-formed in two cohorts, convalescent patients (CP) from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and BBIBP-CorV vaccinated population. It was found that nAbs and binding antibodies emerged at 14 days post the 1st dose of vaccination, reached peaks at 28 days after 2nd dose vaccination and then gradually declined over time. CP-6M (convalescent patients up to 6 months) from COVID-19 presented stronger nAbs or binding antibodies responses than vaccinees 90 days or 180 days after 2nd dose vaccination. CMIA or SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA correlated well with PVNT with high consistency in the two cohorts. It shown that nAbs and binding antibodies can keep 6 months both in CP and vaccinees. Most importantly, our data show the application of using CMIA and SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA as rapid screening tests for nAb titer and could be used as alternative strategies for quickly evaluating SARS-CoV-2 nAbs responses in vaccine research. © 2022 by the authors.

As of 19 September 2021, approximately 4.5 million people have died globally, and 215 million active cases have been reported. To date, six vaccines have been developed and approved for human use. However, current production and supply capabilities are unable to meet global demands to immunize the entire world population. Only a few countries have been able to successfully vaccinate many of their residents. Therefore, an alternative vaccine that can be prepared in an easy and cost-effective manner is urgently needed. A vaccine that could be prepared in this manner, as well as can be preserved and transported at room temperature, would be of great benefit to public health. It is possible to develop such an alternative vaccine by using nano-or microparticle platforms. These platforms address most of the existing vaccine limitations as they are stable at room temperature, are inexpensive to produce and distribute, can be administered orally, and do not require cold chain storage for transportation or preservation. Particulate vaccines can be administered as either oral solutions or in sublingual or buccal film dosage forms. Besides improved patient compliance, the major advantage of oral, sublingual, and buccal routes of administration is that they can elicit mucosal immunity. Mucosal immunity, along with systemic immunity, can be a strong defense against SARS-CoV-2 as the virus enters the system through inhalation or saliva. This review discusses the possibility to produce a particulate COVID vaccine by using nano-or microparticles as platforms for oral administration or in sublingual or buccal film dosage forms in order to accelerate global vaccination. © 2021 by the authors.

We reported the effective use of real-time geospatial analysis to identify barriers and gaps in COVID-19 vaccination in a minority population living in South Texas on the US-Mexico Border, to inform vaccination campaign strategies. We developed 4 rank-based approaches to evaluate the vaccination gap at the census tract level, which considered both population vulnerability and vaccination priority and eligibility. We identified areas with the highest vaccination gaps using different assessment approaches. Real-time geospatial analysis to identify vaccination gaps is critical to rapidly increase vaccination uptake, and to reach herd immunity in the vulnerable and the vaccine hesitant groups. Our results assisted the City of Brownsville Public Health Department in adjusting real-time targeting of vaccination, gathering coverage assessment, and deploying services to areas identified as high vaccination gap.

With the continuation of the epidemic, SARS-CoV-2 variants are constantly emerging. In particular, the mutation of the spike protein can cause changes in the infectivity and antigenicity of the virus, resulting in an increase in the infectivity and a decline in the protective efficacy of existing vaccines, and even the replacement of epidemic strains. This is also one of the reasons why the epidemic has not been effectively controlled so far. Nowadays, the main circulating variants have changed their characteristics to a certain extent, and the neutralization sensitivity of some variants to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, immune sera and convalescent sera has decreased to a certain extent compared with the original strains. The emergence of variants is not only related to the characteristics of the virus itself, but also to the changes of transmission host and the chronic infection in people with deficient immunity. The emerging variants should be closely monitored, and their functional characteristics should be systematically studied so as to provide data for vaccine research and development and the designation of immunization strategies. © 2022 Society of Microbiology and Immunology.

A semi-structured questionnaire guide was developed using ground theory to conduct in-depth interviews. A total of 36 participants gave consent for an audio-recorded interview. Results have shown that most of the respondents believed that SARS-CoV-2 is a natural virus, not man-made, that causes a disease just like other viruses and it is absurd to believe that the vaccine is being used by foreign powers for the implantation of microchips just to control humans. A general opinion thatwhich reflected from the in-depth interview is that the pharmaceutical companies may be hiding some important information on COVID-19 to promote the sale of their product. Some doubts on the reliability and trustworthiness on the COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy data were noticed among the respondents. Factors leading to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were adverse reaction, cost of COVID-19 vaccine, and limited data on safety and efficacy profile of COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health professionals is a major hindrance to our current fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of this study are alarming, and the stakeholders must consider this ongoing vaccination campaign as an opportunity to formulate a mechanism to ensure high vaccination rate among general public and healthcare providers in Pakistan. KEY POINTS What was already known? According to World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is one of the ten major threats to global healthcare system and it is a major barrier to achieve herd immunity around the globe. Pakistan has begun vaccinating its people in a systematic phase-wise manner under which the healthcare workers and elderly people are prioritized for vaccination. Previous experience tells us that vaccine hesitancy is a major problem in Pakistan and it is better to understand perceptions of pharmacists about COVID-19 vaccine who are the primary source of information for most of general population. What this study adds: This study is first of its kind to explore vaccine hesitancy among Pakistani pharmacists and the results of this study show that majority of the participants were willing to get COVID-19 vaccine and few of them have even got themselves vaccinated at the start of vaccination campaign. Many among the willing participants considered cost of vaccine, adverse reactions, limited data, safety, and efficacy as major hindrance to their decision to get vaccine. Few participants were found highly vaccine-hesitant because of their staunch belief in the prevalent myths and rumors about COVID-19 vaccine. © 2022 The Author(s).

Consequently, global coverage is expected to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 by 2023 or 2024, although with highly variable coverage percentages among countries. In Latin America, immunization against COVID-19 faces different challenges to achieve herd immunity. To date (February 6, 2022), the countries that had several doses needed to immunize their populations with at least two doses (number of doses between population) were Peru (520.7%), Chile (458.4%), Argentina (298.0%), Brazil (236.6%), Bolivia (206.0%) and Uruguay (unconfirmed doses). On the other hand, Uruguay (210.7%) and Chile (238.3%) have applied twice as many doses as their populations. Argentina (194.3%), Brazil (173.6%), Ecuador (170.3%), Peru (170.3%), Costa Rica (161.1%), and Panama (153.5%) are on the way to achieving this goal. In addition, Latin American countries also showed an insufficient distribution of vaccines and a storage capacity limited to only a few cities and multiple frequencies of vaccine hesitancy. Due to these scenarios, the production of more vaccine doses and equitable distribution to the rest of the population within the Latin American region should remain a public health priority to achieve collective immunity in the shortest time possible. © 2022 Asociacion Colombiana de Infectologia.

Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation was critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs likely require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with comorbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression. Methods: We evaluate various age-based vaccine distributions using a validated mathematical model based on current epidemic trends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not have been included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for age-specific immune patterns in both states at the time of the start of the vaccination program. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020–2021 had equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff. Results: We find that allocating a substantial proportion (>75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. This result is robust to different profiles of waning vaccine efficacy and several different assumptions on age mixing during and after lockdown periods. As we do not explicitly model other high-mortality groups, our results on vaccine allocation apply to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. A median of 327 to 340 deaths can be avoided in Rhode Island (3444 to 3647 in Massachusetts) by optimizing vaccine allocation and vaccinating the elderly first. The vaccination campaigns are expected to save a median of 639 to 664 lives in Rhode Island and 6278 to 6618 lives in Massachusetts in the first half of 2021 when compared to a scenario with no vaccine. A policy of vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and would result in 0.5% to 1% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021. Conclusions: Assuming high vaccination coverage (>28%) and no major changes in distancing, masking, gathering size, hygiene guidelines, and virus transmissibility between 1 January 2021 and 1 July 2021 a combination of vaccination and population immunity may lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021. © 2021, The Author(s).","Mathematical modeling; Optimal vaccine allocation; Real-time seroprevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination","Age Factors; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Care Rationing; Humans; Incidence; Massachusetts; Models, Theoretical; Public Health; Resource Allocation; Rhode Island; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccination Coverage; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; attack rate; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; herd immunity; hospitalization; human; immunization; lockdown; Massachusetts; mathematical model; mortality; public health; resource allocation; Rhode Island; risk factor; seroprevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccine allocation; virus transmission; age; communicable disease control; epidemiology; health care organization; incidence; organization and management; prevention and control; procedures; resource allocation; theoretical model; vaccination; vaccination coverage"

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is fundamentally different from that of other vaccines due to the new technologies being used, rapid development, and widespread global distribution. Attitudes on vaccines are largely driven by online information, particularly information on social media. The first step toward influencing attitudes about immunization is understanding the current patterns of communication that characterize the immunization debate on social media platforms. Objective: We aimed to evaluate societal attitudes, communication trends, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake through social media content analysis to inform communication strategies promoting vaccine acceptance. Methods: Social network analysis (SNA) and unsupervised machine learning were used to characterize COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter globally. Tweets published in English and French were collected through the Twitter application programming interface between November 19 and 26, 2020, just following the announcement of initial COVID-19 vaccine trials. SNA was used to identify social media clusters expressing mistrustful opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the SNA results, an unsupervised machine learning approach to natural language processing using a sentence-level algorithm transfer function to detect semantic textual similarity was performed in order to identify the main themes of vaccine hesitancy. Results: The tweets (n=636,516) identified that the main themes driving the vaccine hesitancy conversation were concerns of safety, efficacy, and freedom, and mistrust in institutions (either the government or multinational corporations). A main theme was the safety and efficacy of mRNA technology and side effects. The conversation around efficacy was that vaccines were unlikely to completely rid the population of COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction testing is flawed, and there is no indication of long-term T-cell immunity for COVID-19. Nearly one-third (45,628/146,191, 31.2%) of the conversations on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy clusters expressed concerns for freedom or mistrust of institutions (either the government or multinational corporations) and nearly a quarter (34,756/146,191, 23.8%) expressed criticism toward the government's handling of the pandemic. Conclusions: Social media content analysis combined with social network analysis provides insights into the themes of the vaccination conversation on Twitter. The themes of safety, efficacy, and trust in institutions will need to be considered, as targeted outreach programs and intervention strategies are deployed on Twitter to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.  © Jean-Christophe Boucher, Kirsten Cornelson, Jamie L Benham, Madison M Fullerton, Theresa Tang, Cora Constantinescu, Mehdi Mourali, Robert J Oxoby, Deborah A Marshall, Hadi Hemmati, Abbas Badami, Jia Hu, Raynell Lang.","attitudes; behavior; Coronavirus; COVID-19; machine learning; public health; risk reduction; social media; social network analysis; Twitter",""

Using publicly available, country-level population estimates and COVID-19 vaccination data, we provide unique insights into the uptake trends of COVID-19 vaccinations in the 15 countries that comprise the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). Based on the vaccination rates in the ECOWAS region after three months of commencing COVID-19 vaccinations, we provide a projection of the trajectory and speed of vaccination needed to achieve a COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate of at least 60% of the total ECOWAS population. After three months of the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines across the ECOWAS countries, only 0.27% of the region's total population had been fully vaccinated. If ECOWAS countries follow this trajectory, the sub-region will have less than 1.6% of the total population fully vaccinated after 18 months of vaccine deployment. Our projection shows that to achieve a COVID-19 vaccination coverage of at least 60% of the total population in the ECOWAS sub-region after 9, 12 and 18 months of vaccine deployment; the speed of vaccination must be increased to 10, 7 and 4 times the current trajectory, respectively. West African governments must deploy contextually relevant and culturally acceptable strategies for COVID-19 vaccine procurements, distributions and implementations in order to achieve reasonable coverage and save lives, sooner rather than later. © ","COVID-19; epidemiology; public health; vaccines","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; sinopharm; sinovac; vaxzevria; African Union; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; health care delivery; human; immunization; morbidity; mortality; priority journal; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy; West African"

Sterilizing immunity requires neutralizing antibodies at the site of infection, which for respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 implies the occurrence of neutralizing IgA in mucosal secretions. Systemic vaccination by intramuscular delivery induces no or low-titer neutralizing IgA against vaccine antigens. Mucosal priming or boosting, is needed to provide sterilizing immunity. On the other side of the coin, sterilizing immunity, by zeroing interhuman transmission, could confine SARS-CoV-2 in animal reservoirs, preventing spontaneous attenuation of virulence in humans as presumably happened with the endemic coronaviruses.

Parents are facing tremendous stress in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination program for children. In this study, we aimed to investigate parents’ perceptions and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine for their children in Saudi Arabia. A well-designed, pre-validated, Google ques-tionnaire was distributed to parents through social media websites. The selection of the participants was based on the simple random sample technique. The study sample size was 1304 participants, with 342 males (26.2%), and 962 females (73.8%). The personal information, perception about COVID-19, and their children’s vaccination status were obtained. Among the participants, 602 (46.1%) were will-ing to get the COVID-19 vaccination for their children, whereas 382 (29.3%) were hesitant to inoculate their children for COVID-19 and 320 (24.4%) were unsure. Age (p = 0.004), gender (p = 0.001), occupation (0.004), income (p = 0.030), and vaccination status (p = 0.001) had an influence on the parents’ acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination of their children. On the other hand, education level, number of children, and having been previously infected with COVID-19 had no statistically significant effect on the parent acceptance. The correlation of parents’ knowledge about COVID-19 and their agreement to the vaccination of their children was statistically significant, along with gender (males were more knowledgeable, with p < 0.001), occupation, income (higher income showed a statistical difference, with p < 0.001), and vaccination status (p < 0.001). There was a decrease in parents’ acceptance toward the COVID-19 children vaccine in Saudi Arabia, which requires more attention and focus from health providers to eliminate fear and anxiety among the parents through additional educational programs and events to decrease the resistance toward the vaccination of children. More emphasis is required to increase the awareness of parents and convey the importance of the vaccine for children. In addition, more studies are needed to ensure the vaccine’s safety. © 2022 by the authors.

Iran, as one of the countries that reported over five million infected cases by September 2021, has been concerned with the urgent development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we report the results of a study on potency and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (FAKHRAVAC) in a preclinical study so as to confirm its potential for further clinical evaluation. Here, we developed a pilot-scale production of FAKHRAVAC, a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate that induces neutralizing antibodies in Balb/c mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates (Rhesus macaques—RM). After obtaining ethical code of IR.IUMS.REC.1399.566, immunizations of animals were conducted by using either of three different vaccine dilutions; High (H): 10 µg/dose, Medium (M): 5 µg/dose, and Low (L): 1 µg/dose, respectively. In the process of screening for viral seeds, viral strains that resulted in the most severe clinical manifestation in patients have been isolated for vaccine development. The viral seed produced the optimal immunity against SARS-CoV-2 virus, which suggests a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains. The seroconversion rate at the H-, M-, and L-dose groups of all tested animals reached 100% by 28 days after immunization. These data support the eligibility of FAKHRAVAC vaccine candidate for further evaluation in a clinical trial. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite the proven efficacy and safety profiles of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, there are still a substantial number of people who express vaccine hesitancy. Factors that influence vaccine decision-making are heterogenous, complex, and context specific and may be caused or amplified by uncontrolled online information or misinformation. With respect to COVID-19, the recent emergence of novel variants of concern that give rise to milder disease also drives vaccine hesitancy. Healthcare professionals remain one of the most trusted groups to advise and provide information to those ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination and should be equipped with adequate resources and information as well as practical guidance to empower them to effectively discuss concerns. This article seeks to summarize the currently available information to address the most common concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination.

Given the COVID-19 vaccination capacity limitations, an urgent question was raised regarding whether it would be better to (i) complete double-dose COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare personnel and older adults before beginning double-dose vaccination of younger adults (double-dose strategy) or (ii) allocate a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all adults regardless of age before administering the second dose (single-dose-first strategy). We used an age-structured susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) compartment model to compare the effectiveness of possible COVID-19 vaccination strategies and the length of public health and social measures (PHSM) to minimize the cumulative COVID-19 disease risk and death toll. Our results indicate that if the single-dose-first strategy was taken, an estimated total of 1,387,078 persons, i.e., 263,315 children, 928,518 young adults, and 195,245 older adults, would develop COVID-19, resulting in 15,442 deaths. In contrast, if the double-dose strategy was taken instead, an estimated total of 1,900,172 persons, i.e., 377,107 children, 1,315,927 young adults, and 207,138 older adults, would develop COVID-19, yielding 17,423 deaths. Real-time investigation favored the disease transmission blocking option, i.e., single-dose vaccination strategy. Applying the single-dose-first strategy should yield a smaller epidemic size than applying the double-dose strategy; however, for both strategies, PHSM will be essential by the time second-dose COVID-19 vaccination is complete among all adults. © 2022 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

In contrast, only 2.5% of people from LICs have come in under COVID-19 vaccination for at least a single shot.

Using a mathematical epidemiological model, we project that childhood vaccination carries minimal risk and yields modest public health benefits. These include large relative reductions in child morbidity and mortality, although the absolute reduction is small because these events are rare. Furthermore, the model predicts “altruistic” absolute reductions in adult cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. However, vaccinating children to benefit adults should be considered from an ethical as well as a public health perspective. From a global health perspective, an additional ethical consideration is the justice of giving priority to children in high-income settings at low risk of severe disease while vaccines have not been made available to vulnerable adults in low-income settings. IMPORTANCE Countries have recently begun implementation of childhood vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. Because SARS-CoV-2 disease severity is remarkably age dependent, vaccinating children may have modest public health benefits, relative to the unequivocal benefit of vaccinating vulnerable older adults. Furthermore, vaccinating children to “altruistically” increase herd immunity should be considered from an ethical as well as a public health perspective. An additional question is related to global social justice: should priority be given to vaccinating children in high-income settings while older adult populations in low-resource settings have limited access to vaccine? To address the risks and benefits of childhood vaccination, we provide a balanced commentary, supported by a mathematical epidemiological model, using Australia and Alberta, Canada, as case studies. We give highlights of the modeling findings in the commentary and include details in the supplemental materials for interested readers.

Being an RNA virus, the Covid-19 virus is continuing to mutate, resulting in the emergence of new variants with high transmissibility, such as the recently discovered Omicron variant. In this paper, we consider the conditions that may facilitate viral mutations and the emergence of variants with the ability to evade immunity. Here, we have discussed the importance of vaccination with the currently available vaccines. These vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious disease, hospitalization, and death from Covid-19. However, the antibody response induced by these vaccines is short-lasting and there are reports of breakthrough infections. A stable and persistent interaction between T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells is needed for robust B cell memory response. We discussed the potential reasons behind the breakthrough infections and underscored the importance of developing better second-generation vaccines that may not necessitate frequent booster immunizations and are preventive in nature. This may involve the development of multivalent vaccines and creating vaccines against other viral proteins including conserved proteins. Vaccine hesitancy remains a notable hurdle for implementing vaccination. Furthermore, we recommend different approaches to increase vaccine acceptance, which is a critical translational component of a successful vaccine strategy. These perspectives on overcoming the pandemic's current challenges provide strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2 globally. © 2021","Breakthrough infections; Global vaccination; Mutation; RNA virus; Second-generation vaccines; Transparency; Vaccine hesitancy; Variants","Antibodies, Viral; B-Lymphocyte Subsets; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Immunologic Memory; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; T-Lymphocytes; Vaccination; Vaccination Hesitancy; Vaccine Development; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; viral protein; virus antibody; antibody response; B lymphocyte; breakthrough infection; coronavirus disease 2019; germinal center; hospitalization; human; Review; Tfh cell; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; virus immunity; virus strain; virus transmission; B lymphocyte subpopulation; biosynthesis; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunological memory; immunology; pandemic; prevention and control; T lymphocyte; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity"

In a cross-country analysis of vaccine hesitant respondents across Latin America in January 2021, we experimentally tested how five features of mass vaccination campaigns—the vaccine’s producer, efficacy, endorser, distributor, and current population uptake rate—shifted willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. We find that citizens preferred Western-produced vaccines, but were highly influenced by factual information about vaccine efficacy. Vaccine hesitant individuals were more responsive to vaccine messengers with medical expertise than political, religious, or media elite endorsements. Citizen trust in foreign governments, domestic leaders, and state institutions moderated the effects of the campaign features on vaccine acceptance. These findings can help inform the design of unfolding mass inoculation campaigns. © 2021, The Author(s).","","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; government; herd immunity; human; information processing; leadership; mass immunization; medical expert; politics; public health campaign; religion; social acceptance; social media; South and Central America; trust; vaccine hesitancy"

How can collectives be considered ""immune""? Over the course of more than a century of use of the term, scientists have developed many different understandings of the concept in response to this inherent tension. Originating among veterinary scientists in the United States in the late 19th century, the concept was adopted by British scientists researching human infectious disease by the early 1920s. It soon became a staple concept for epidemiologists interested in disease ecology, helping to articulate the population dynamics of diseases such as diphtheria and influenza. Finally, though more traditional understandings of the concept remained in scientific use, in the era after World War II, it increasingly came to signal the objective and outcome of mass vaccination. Recognizing the complexity of scientific efforts to resolve the paradox of herd immunity may help us consider the best distribution of immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunity, Herd; Mass Vaccination; Public Opinion; SARS-CoV-2; drug therapy; herd immunity; human; immunology; mass immunization; prevention and control; public opinion"

Manufacturers' production of the vaccines has elicited a range of emotions from the public, including acceptance, rejection and even doubt. Sociodemographic factors play a role in Malaysians’ perceptions. Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyse Malaysians' perceptions to the National COVID-19 Immunization Program (NIP). For four weeks, an online survey was employed to perform the research. To answer the study's objectives, a descriptive analysis and the one-way ANOVA were applied. The study's findings revealed that the component of confidence in NIP, particularly in obtaining herd immunity to ensure life returns to normal, is important. There is a widespread of public mistrust about the government's ability to manage vaccinations. The vaccination system should be improved according to substantial viewpoints regarding the program. Overall, confidence in NIP was strong while hesitancy in it was moderate. The public’s perceptions of NIP indicated that NIP in Malaysia received high acceptance and cooperation for oneself and family to be vaccinated. Vaccination is widely accepted in Malaysia by the multi-religious population as the need for vaccination is consistent with religious demands. © 2022, Malaysian Journal of Public Health Medicine.

New problems have arisen such as the so-called ‘vaccine nationalism’. Equity-preserving responses, such as the COVAX mechanism, have all but failed. New and unexpected actors at the national level have emerged. Many questions remain to be answered, such as the duration of vaccine coverage, its ability to block transmission and the medium- and long-term side effects. To what extent will states accept the industry’s demand not to be responsible for possible side effects; to what extent contracts between the industry and governments will be transparent, or whether common public goods will be patented. Every day more and more questions arise due to the speed at which the virus advances and solutions are proposed.

Newer variants of interest and concern have continued to emerge, placing the need for policymakers to rethink prevention strategies to end the pandemic. The approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for public health use in December 2020 was seen as a significant development towards pandemic control and possibly ending the pandemic. However, breakthrough infections have continued to be observed among the ‘fully vaccinated’, and the duration and sustainability of vaccine-induced immunity has remained a topical public health discourse. In the absence of accurate public health communication, the breakthrough infections and waning immunity concepts have potential to further compound vaccine hesitancy. With this viewpoint, we discuss breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections, waning immunity, the need for COVID-19 booster shots, vaccine inequities, and the need to address vaccine hesitancy adequately to propel global vaccination programs forward. © 2022 by the authors.

This study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccination intention in Greece regarding protection behaviors and perceptions of the pandemic. Methods: A total of 3753 participants completed a specially designed electronic questionnaire anonymously and voluntarily. The study population consisted of healthcare workers, students, members of professional societies, teachers, and professors. The questionnaire was composed of four parts pertaining to demographic data and possible changes in hygiene attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In total, 43.3% of the participants stated that SARS-CoV-2 poses a significant risk. The most widespread protection practice was avoiding crowded places (90.1%), followed by reducing the use of public transport (86.1%) and washing their hands with soap and water more often than usual (84.2%). Women undertook significantly more behavioral changes than men and participants of other nationalities. About half of the participants (44%) implemented seven behavioral changes. Lower personal and general perceived risk due to COVID-19 was significantly associated with lower intention to get vaccinated. Conclusion: Strong hesitancy was observed towards COVID-19 vaccination. There is a need for further studies to be conducted to investigate the benefits and safety of vaccines for the purpose of better informing the public. Healthcare personnel can and should play a key role in this process. © 2022 by the authors.

This was to identify the extent of exposure by testing specific IgG antibodies against COVID-19. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to find the prevalence of seropositivity in Mumbai, which included 10,197 samples belonging to patients visiting public dispensaries (slum population, 6006) and private (nonslum population, 4191) laboratories of Aapli Chikitsa network for blood investigations for non-COVID illnesses. The ward-wise number of unlinked anonymous samples from 24 wards was predecided by using probability proportionate sampling. The samples were collected using quota sampling technique as per predecided sample for each ward. These samples collected from nonimmunized individuals were tested for IgG antibodies at the Molecular Biology Laboratory of Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases by chemiluminescence assay (CLIA) method. Results: The overall seropositivity was found to be 36.3% (41.6% in slum and 28.59% in nonslum population). It was more in city wards (38.28%) followed by western suburb (36.47%) and then eastern suburb wards (34.86%), matching with the proportion of cases in these wards during the study period. There was no significant difference in seropositivity among males and females and in different age groups. Conclusions: Seropositivity is higher in slum areas than nonslum areas. It has reduced in slum areas and increased in nonslum areas as compared to findings of serosurveys 1 and 2. This explains the detection of a greater number of cases from nonslum areas in the second wave. The average seropositivity of 36.3% justifies the necessity of immunization on a wider scale in the city. Periodic serosurveys are required at fixed intervals to monitor the trend of infection and level of herd immunity. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Design Deterministic, compartmental, discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) modelling. Participants Population in England. Interventions Mass vaccination programmes. Outcome measures Daily and cumulative number of deaths from COVID-19. Results If vaccine efficacy remains high (85%), the vaccine-induced sterilising immunity lasts ≥182 days, and the reinfectivity is greatly reduced (by ≥60%), annual mass vaccination programmes can prevent further COVID-19 outbreaks in England. Under optimistic scenarios, with annual revaccination programmes, the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths is estimated to be from 130 000 to 150 000 by the end of 2024. However, the total number of COVID-19 deaths may be up to 431 000 by the end of 2024, under scenarios with compromised vaccine efficacy (62.5%), short duration of natural and vaccine immunity (365/182 days) and small reduction in reinfectivity (30%). Under the assumed scenarios, more frequent revaccinations are associated with smaller total numbers and lower peaks of daily deaths from COVID-19. Conclusions Under optimistic scenarios, mass immunisation using efficacious vaccines may enable society safely to return to normality. However, under plausible scenarios with low vaccine efficacy and short durability of immunity, COVID-19 could continue to cause recurrent waves of severe morbidity and mortality despite frequent vaccinations.

In this article, we show the utility of an inductive approach–latent class analysis (LCA)–that allows us to characterize the size and nature of different vaccine attitude groups; and to compare how these groups differ across countries as well as across demographic subgroups within countries. We perform this analysis using original survey data collected in the US, UK, and Canada. We also show that these classes are strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination intent and perceptions of the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting that attitudes about vaccines to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic are well explained by latent vaccine attitudes that precede the pandemic. More specifically, we find four substantive classes of vaccine attitudes: strong supporters, supporters with concerns, vaccine hesitant, and “anti-vax” as well as a fifth measurement error class. The strong “anti-vax” sentiment class is small in all three countries, while the strong supporter class is the largest across all three countries. We observe different distributions of class assignments in different demographic groups–most notably education and political leaning (partisanship and ideology). © 2022 The Author(s).

The Omicron's R0 could be as high as 10, while for the Delta, it was under seven. Also, the WHO called the risk ""very high"" 1. The spread of this variant and the possibility of peaks resulting from it have raised concerns in many countries. Herein, the solutions are briefly introduced and discussed. Medical-grade mashing up Masks are always recommended to protect against coronavirus, but now, with the spread of the Omicron variant, cloth masks, which were considered suitable for low-risk public settings in 2020, are not strongly recommended because they do not offer adequate protection. It is essential to wear a medical-grade mask, at least a three-ply surgical one, to protect against this variant 2. Third dose vaccination The third dose injection of COVID-19 vaccines has been rolled out to enhance protection and maintain immunity since the summer because of the evidence indicating reductions in infection and disease following the three-shot vaccination 1,3,4. Therefore, although there were unresolved ethical issues regarding equity in access to the vaccines 3, the three-dose vaccination program is on the agenda, and so far, about 400 million third doses have been injected worldwide 34. New laboratory results show that the Omicron has seriously challenged the potency of two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in preventing infection 5. With the Omicron variant spreading, recommendations and planning for speeding up the program have been considered 4. Updating vaccines Because data on the effectiveness of current vaccines for the Omicron variant were not favorable, Pfizer- BioNTech and Moderna are working on a specific vaccine 156. Moderna could supply two to three billion vaccine doses in 2022; however, assigning all production while other variants are in circulation is a challenge 6,7 Another challenge is creating the two-tier system that delivers out-of-date vaccines to developing countries 1. Pursuing universal vaccine According to scientific evidence and ecological reality, novel coronaviruses will continue to infect animals and be a potential threat to humans, and as a result, viruses with unknown transmissibility and lethality may appear at any time. The development of a long-lasting vaccine against all or most coronaviruses for all ages by applying the knowledge gained from characterizing the range of genetic diversity in animal species and better understanding the pathogenesis of the disease should be considered 7 In addition, the fact that the Omicron variant was potentially developed from a patient with chronic COVID-19 who was immunized with a vaccine may indicate that the virus is opportunistic in its development and mutations to escape the immune system. The role of vaccine-induced immunity in generating novel variants should be considered when planning regular vaccine shots 8. Concluding remark Wearing medical-grade masks and injecting a third dose from the current vaccines are the most available and fastest solutions to protect against the Omicron. Developing its updated specific vaccines and the universal vaccine are further scientific steps. At the same time, ethical topics and issues regarding the variants generation after vaccination should not be overlooked. © 2022, Avicenna Journal of Medical Biotechnology.

Despite this impact, the immunological processes involved in protective responses are not entirely understood and vaccine development has been largely empirical. Recent technological advances offer the opportunity to reveal the immunology underlying vaccine response at an unprecedented resolution. These data could revolutionize the way vaccines are developed and tested and further augment their role in securing the health of children around the world. Areas covered: Systems level information and tools are now being deployed by vaccinologists at all stages of the vaccine development pathway; however, this review will specifically describe some of the key findings that have be gleaned from multi-omics datasets collected in the context of childhood immunization. Expert opinion: Despite the success of vaccines, there remains hard-to-target pathogens, refractory to current vaccination strategies. Moreover, zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential are a threat to global health, as recently illustrated by COVID-19. Systems vaccinology holds a great deal of promise in revealing a greater understanding of vaccine responses and consequently modernizing vaccinology. However, there is a need for future studies–particularly in vulnerable populations that are targets for vaccination programmes–if this potential is to be fulfilled. © 2022 The Author(s).

Twelve of these are in the advanced stages of clinical investigation, and promising results in the phase 3 trials have already paved the way for their regulatory approval and subsequent dissemination for global use. Preliminary and interim results of some of these candidate vaccines are being analyzed for public dissemination. Some of these vaccines have already been rolled out to immunize not only the highest risk individuals but also the general population in several countries. Once their safety and efficacy are established, the next limiting step would be their mass manufacturing by the pharmaceutical companies to fulfill the global demand. The challenge of manufacturing billions of doses of highquality vaccines is under-appreciated at the moment. A massive vaccination drive would be needed to protect people of all ages. The timely and coordinated execution of the vaccination effort would require unprecedented coordination at the national and international levels for generating funds to purchase the required doses of vaccines, fair distribution of doses and managing the mechanics of delivering vaccines throughout the world. © 2021 by the authors.","COVID-19; Global demand; Pharmaceutical companies; Vaccine","ad26 cov2 s; ad26.cov2.s vaccine; bbibp corv; bbibp-corv vaccine; comirnaty; convidicea; coronavac; covaxin; covlp; elasomeran; mrna 1273; nvx-cov2373 vaccine; sputnik v; sputnik v vaccine; vaxzevria; virus vector; wibp corv; wibp-corv vaccine; adaptive immunity; adverse event; antibody response; antigen presenting cell; Article; clinical laboratory; coronavirus disease 2019; drug administration route; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug industry; hospitalization; human; humoral immunity; IC50; immunization; immunogenicity; manufacturing industry; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); protein subunit; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; variant of concern; virus inactivation; virus like agent; World Health Organization"

This heavily mutated variant is rapidly spreading around the world. Infected individuals with the Omicron variant may suffer from flu-like symptoms, and infected with the Delta variant frequently report low oxygen levels, high pulse rates, and a loss of smell and taste. Also, the Omicron variant causes asymptomatic or mild disease so far, and not any severe illness as like Delta, and this new variant has a 15% to 80% reduced risk of hospitalization than the Delta variant. Scientists are worried about the possibility of escaping the immunity by the Omicron variants and subvariants among fully vaccinated and recovered COVID-19 patients. Two doses of available vaccines are found to be partially ineffective in protecting this new variant, therefore, the third dose as a booster is recommended to enhance antibody level. Moreover, some antiviral drugs significantly reduce hospitalization or death among mild to severe COVID-19 patients. All authorized antiviral drugs are effective against viral replication for most SARS-CoV-2 variants, and particularly some monoclonal antibodies may not now be effective in treating COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need to update existing vaccines, develop more effective and newer vaccines as well as additional monoclonal antibodies to counter Omicron. Therefore, along with close monitoring of Omicron characteristics, the present study suggests that health safety guidelines, mass immunization, early diagnosis, and search for effective antiviral drugs should be the approaches to fight against newer SARS-CoV-2 variants. © The Author(s) 2022.","antiviral agents; B.1.1.529; Coronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccines; Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-COV-2 variants","antivirus agent; corticosteroid; cytokine receptor antagonist; molnupiravir; nirmatrelvir; nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; ritonavir; tozinameran; vaxzevria; adaptive immunity; antibody blood level; Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; disease transmission; early diagnosis; flu like syndrome; gene mutation; human; infection rate; mass immunization; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; public health; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; symptomatology; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; virus cell interaction; virus characterization; virus infectivity; virus replication; virus strain"

Over the course of the pandemic, due to the advance of whole-genome sequencing technologies, an unprecedented number of genomes have been generated, providing both invaluable insights into the ongoing evolution and epidemiology of the virus and allowing the identification of hundreds of circulating genetic variants during the pandemic. In recent months variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have an increased number of mutations on the Spike protein have brought concern all over the world. These have been called “variants of concerns” (VOCs), and/or “variants of interests” (VOIs) as it has been suggested that their genome mutations might impact transmission, immune control, and virulence. Tracking the spread of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial to inform public health efforts and control the ongoing pandemic. In this review, a concise characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational patterns of the main VOCs and VOIs circulating and cocirculating worldwide has been presented to determine the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 threat to better understand the virus genetic diversity and its potential impact on vaccination strategy. © 2021 The Authors.

In January 2020, the WHO declared this pandemic a public health emergency. This pandemic has already caused over 5.3 million deaths from more than 272 million infections. The development of a successful vaccine is an urgent global priority to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent further fatalities. Researchers are fast-tracking this process, and there have already been significant developments in preclinical and clinical phases in a relatively short period of time. Some vaccines have been approved either for emergency use or mass application in recent months. Areas covered: Herein, we provide a general understanding of the fast-tracked clinical trial procedures and highlight recent successes in preclinical and clinical trials to generate a clearer picture of the progress of COVID-19 vaccine development. Expert opinion: A good number of vaccines have been rolled out within a short period a feat unprecedented in medical history.

Management Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) are efficient mitigation strategies. The success of these NPIs is dependent on the approval and commitment of the population. The launch of a mass vaccination program in many countries in late December 2020 with mRNA vaccines, adenovirus-based vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines has generated hope for the end of the pandemic. Current Issues The continuous appearance of new pathogenic viral strains and the ability of vaccines to prevent infection and transmission raise important concerns as we try to achieve community immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants. The need of a second and even third generation of vaccines has already been acknowledged by the WHO and governments. Perspectives There is a critical and urgent need for a balanced and integrated strategy for the management of the COVID-19 outbreaks organized on three axes: (1) P revention of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2) Detection and early diagnosis of patients at risk of disease worsening, and (3) Anticipation of medical care (PDA). Conclusion The PDA strategy integrated into state policy for the support and expansion of health systems and introduction of digital organizations (i.e., telemedicine, e-Health, artificial intelligence, and machine-learning technology) is of major importance for the preservation of citizens' health and life world-wide. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

As the pandemic evolves with no certainty of a herd immunity threshold, universal vaccination of at-risk populations is desirable. However, vaccine hesitancy threatens the return to normalcy, and healthcare workers (HCWs) must embrace their ambassadorial role of shoring up vaccine confidence. Unfortunately, voluntary vaccination has been suboptimal among HCWs in the United States, a priority group for whom immunization is essential for maintaining health system capacity and the safety of high-risk patients in their care. Consequently, some health systems have implemented mandates to improve compliance. Areas covered: This article discusses the ethical and practical considerations of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies for HCWs utilizing some components of the World Health Organization’s framework and the unique context of a pandemic with evolving infection dynamics. Expert opinion: COVID-19 vaccine mandates for universal immunization of HCWs raise ethical and practical debates about their appropriateness, especially when the vaccines are pending full approval in most jurisdictions. Given the superiority of the vaccines to safety and testing protocols and their favorable safety profile, we encourage health systems to adopt vaccination mandates through participatory processes that address the concerns of stakeholders. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; health personnel; mandatory program; public health; vaccination","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Personnel; Humans; Policy; Social Justice; United States; Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; health care personnel; health care policy; herd immunity threshold; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; immune response; immunogenicity; mandatory program; pandemic; risk assessment; social justice; United States; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; virus load; administration and dosage; epidemiology; legislation and jurisprudence; policy; prevention and control; social justice"

Currently, the Standard Public Health Protective practices consist of but are not limited to wearing masks, social distancing, isolating sick and exposed people, and contact tracing. Scientists around the globe undertook swift scientific efforts to develop safe and effective therapeutics and vaccines to combat COVID-19. Presently, as of mid-March 2022, 57.05% of the world population have been fully vaccinated, and 65.3% of the United States of America’s (USA) total population have been fully vaccinated while 76.7% have received at least one dose of the vaccine. This article explores the various vaccines created through modern science and technology, including their safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action. Although the vaccines produced are up to 95.0% efficacious, their efficacy wanes over time, underscoring the need for booster doses. Also, vaccination has not been able to prevent “breakthrough” infections. The limitations of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines indicate that further measures are required to ensure a firm control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of certain therapeutic agents because they have shown remarkable clinical outcomes. Several therapeutic agents for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 include Gilead’s remdesivir, Regeneron’s casirivimab and imdevimab combination, Eli Lilly’s baricitinib and remdesivir combination, Pfizer’s co-packaged nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets, and Merck’s molnupiravir capsules. Hence concerted efforts in early and accurate diagnosis, education on the COVID-19 virulence, transmission and preventive measures, global vaccination, and therapeutic agents could bring this COVID-19 pandemic under control across the globe. © The Author(s), 2022.","coronavirus; COVID-19; efficacy; immunization; immunogenicity; safety; SARS-CoV-2; therapeutics; vaccination; vaccines","ad 26 cov 2 s; ad5 ncov; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; baricitinib; bbib corv; bnt 162 b 2; casirivimab plus imdevimab; coronavac; covaxin; covilo; covivac; elasomeran; epivaccorona; favipiravir; folic acid; ibacovavec; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; kovivac; lopinavir; molnupiravir; mrna 1273; neutralizing antibody; nirmatrelvir; remdesivir; ribavirin; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; sputnik v vaccine; tozinameran; umifenovir; vaxzevria; wibp-corv vaccine; zifivax; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotoxicity; Dengue virus; drug efficacy; drug safety; genetic recombination; health care system; histology; human; human cell; immune response; immunogenicity; immunophenotyping; innate immunity; lung injury; memory T lymphocyte; mesenchymal stroma cell; nonhuman; pandemic; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); Review; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; Th1 cell; vaccination; vaccine development; virus load"

COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is important in ensuring the widespread vaccination of the population to achieve herd immunity. Establishing the acceptance of vaccines among healthcare workers, who play a vital role in an immunization program's success, is important. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of social trust and demographic factors on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers. Methods. A cross-sectional survey utilizing an electronic questionnaire inquiring about COVID-19 vaccine uptake, preferences, and concerns was distributed via e-mail to 1,351 North Central Regional Health Authority (NCRHA) healthcare workers of the following categories: medical practitioners, nursing personnel, veterinary surgeons, medical interns, dental interns, paramedics, and pharmacists. These professions were selected as they were granted power to administer COVID-19 vaccines during the period of public emergency by the President of Trinidad and Tobago and were therefore likely to be NCRHA healthcare workers directly involved in vaccine administration services. Bivariate analysis using Chi-squared analysis of association was used to determine the association between the respondents' characteristics and the acceptance of the vaccine and the association between vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers and trust. The association between the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and healthcare workers' characteristics and trust was established using multinomial logistic regression. Results. A total of 584 healthcare workers took part in the study, and 1.4% showed unwillingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The study indicates that age, profession, trust in international public health organizations, and trust in other healthcare providers predict the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare workers, with younger age groups and the nursing profession associated with an unwillingness to accept the vaccine. Gender of the healthcare workers does not predict vaccine acceptance. Conclusions and relevance: efforts towards enhanced vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers should take into consideration age, profession, and the trust in international organizations and other healthcare providers. Sensitization programs aimed at informing and creating awareness among healthcare workers about the COVID-19 vaccines should be age-specific as well as occupation-based.  © 2022 Chavin D.

This research examines individuals’ psychological beliefs that may act as enablers and barriers to vaccination intentions. Using the health beliefs model as a guide to our conceptual framework, we explore factors influencing vaccine hesitancy and health beliefs regarding risks and severity of the disease, along with individual variables such as income, age, religion, altruism, and collectivism. A questionnaire using newly created measures for various antecedents provided 4303 usable responses from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, and the United States. A factor analytic and structural equation model indicates that trust in vaccine approval, the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine for protecting others, and conspiracy beliefs are the most significant drivers of intentions to vaccinate. Older people, those seeking employment, and those who have received a recent influenza vaccine are more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The findings have implications for improving communication strategies targeting individuals about the merits of vaccination, particularly focusing on younger individuals and expanded message framing to include altruistic considerations, and to improve government transparency regarding the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. © 2021","Conspiracy beliefs; COVID-19; Health beliefs model; Immunization; Structural equation model; Vaccination hesitancy","Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Intention; Perception; SARS-CoV-2; United States; Vaccination; influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; influenza vaccine; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; Australia; Canada; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease severity; education; employment; England; fatigue; female; fever; government; headache; herd immunity; household income; human; hypoxia; immunization; loss of appetite; male; myalgia; nausea; New Zealand; pandemic; public health; religion; respiratory distress; rural area; smoking; urban area; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; aged; behavior; perception; United States; vaccination"

Normally, older individuals and those with underlying health issues are more at risk. However, about 40% of COVID-19 positive individuals are asymptomatic. This review aims to identify suggested mechanisms of diverse manifestations of COVID-19. Studies suggest that T cell-mediated immunity and specific and/or nonspecific immunity from other vaccines could protect against SARS-CoV-2. The potential role of cross-reacting antibodies to coronaviruses that cause the common cold, mumps virus, polio virus, and pneumococcal bacteria are also suggested to help protect against COVID-19. Decreased production of Type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) could also be linked to COVID-19 manifestations. Several studies suggest that ACE2 cell membrane receptors are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the relationship between an abundance of ACE2 receptors and the infectivity of the virus is unknown.

Methods: This prospective observational study (RENAISSANCE) had as a primary end point the evaluation of serologic response to BNT162b2 14 days after a second dose. SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG antibodies were evaluated with LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay (DiaSorin S.p.A.), which is able to detect the presence of both binding and neutralizing antibodies for trimeric spike glycoprotein. Participants were recruited from February 1, 2021, to February 22, 2021. Occurrence of vaccine breakthrough infections was assessed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction on symptomatic and contact cases up to June 6, 2021. Results: Of 2569 staff evaluated, only 4 were nonresponders (0.16%; 95% CI, 0.04% to 0.41%). All 4 nonresponders were severely immunosuppressed and receiving treatment with mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid. At 14 days after the second dose, 67.5% (1733) of staff had anti-S IgG titers of 2000 BAU/mL or higher; 19.2% (494), between 1500 and 2000 BAU/mL; 9.8% (251), between 1000 and 1500 BAU/mL; and 3.4% (87), 1000 BAU/mL or lower. Women had a higher probability of having higher titers than men (64.5% [1044/1618] vs 58.3% [410/703]; P=.005). This was confirmed after adjustment for age group (odds ratio, 1.275; 95% CI, 1.062 to 1.531; P=.009). Four months after the end of the vaccination program, only 13 participants (0.26%) had experienced a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 1 nonresponder. This was the only participant requiring hospitalization for severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The vaccination campaign among health care workers at the ASST GOM Niguarda has resulted in a marked serologic response and reduction of incident COVID-19 cases.

Areas covered: When primary immunity is boosted not by the homologous but by a cross-reacting vaccine, the newly formed antibodies may react better with the primary antigen than with the antigen actually eliciting the response. This form of immune imprinting, which has been observed with influenza, dengue, human immunodeficiency virus, and other pathogens, has profound implications for the approach to seasonal vaccination against a variety of diseases, including COVID-19. Expert opinion: Public health agencies and regulatory bodies have consistently recommended repeated vaccinations every few months as a way to protect against COVID-19. However, the risks and benefits of this approach require scrutiny given the concern for original antigenic sin in response to SARS-CoV-2. This manuscript examines what is known about immune imprinting and looks ahead to explore how this phenomenon may impact seasonal vaccination against emerging SARS-CoV-2 subvariants such as BA.4, BA.5, and BA.5.1, which have been associated with increased transmissibility due to enhanced immune escape. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","BA.5; COVID-19; immune imprinting; omicron; SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2; Seasons; Vaccination; cross reacting antibody; dengue vaccine; elasomeran; mrna 1273; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; virus antigen; influenza vaccine; Article; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; Dengue virus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; immunity; immunization; infection prevention; infectious agent; Influenza virus; medical society; original antigenic sin; primary immune response; revaccination; risk benefit analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; prevention and control; season; vaccination"

The large degree of COVID-19 vaccine refusal, hesitancy, and ineligibility, and initial limitations of supply and distribution require reconsideration of this standard treatment. In this paper, we address these issues for models on endemic and epidemic time scales. On an endemic time scale, we partition the susceptible class into prevaccinated and unprotected subclasses and show that vaccine refusal/hesitancy/ineligibility has a significant impact on endemic behavior, particularly for diseases where immunity is short-lived. On an epidemic time scale, we develop a supply-limited Holling type 3 vaccination model and show that it is an excellent fit to vaccination data. We then extend the Holling model to a COVID-19 scenario in which the population is divided into two risk classes, with the high-risk class being prioritized for vaccination. In both cases, with and without risk stratification, we see significant differences in epidemiological outcomes between the Holling vaccination model and naive models. Finally, we use the new model to explore implications for public health policies in future pandemics. © 2022 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.","compartment models; COVID-19; endemic disease models; epidemic disease models; vaccination","Communicable Diseases; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Mass Vaccination; Pandemics; Vaccination; Epidemiology; Risk perception; Time measurement; Vaccines; Compartment modeling; Disease models; Endemic disease model; Epidemic disease; Epidemic disease model; Infectious disease; Mass vaccination; Time-scales; Vaccination; communicable disease; drug therapy; human; mass immunization; pandemic; prevention and control; vaccination; COVID-19"

Drive-through and traditional walk-through centers have been set up in most cities in the United States and other countries to vaccinate large numbers of people in a short period of time. This article focuses on a pair of mass vaccination clinics conducted on a mid-sized, public university campus. Applying tools from Industrial Engineering, including time study, flow charts, and Queuing Theory, the team identified improvements that resulted in a 40% reduction in the duration of the second clinic while vaccinating almost the same number of patients with no increases in overall staffing. The work resulted in a model for designing mass vaccination clinics in the future and demonstrates that engineers have the ability to support healthcare personnel to increase the performance of the vaccination centers. The inclusion of engineering in the planning and execution of these vaccination clinics can help maximize clinic capacity, reduce the staff and resources needed, and reduce the patients’ waiting time. © 2022 The Author(s).

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a vital role in viral infection and serves as a major target for developing neutralizing antibodies. In this study, the antibody response to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was analyzed by a panel of sera from animals immunized with RBD-based antigens and four linear B-cell epitope peptides (R345, R405, R450 and R465) were revealed. The immunogenicity of three immunodominant peptides (R345, R405, R465) was further accessed by peptide immunization in mice, and all of them could induced potent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating that the three determinants in the RBD were immunogenic. We further generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (15G9, 12C10 and 10D2) binding to these epitope peptides, and finely mapped the three immunodominant epitopes using the corresponding antibodies. Neutralization assays showed that all three monoclonal antibodies had neutralization activity. Results from IFA and western blotting showed that 12C10 was a cross-reactive antibody against both of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Results from conservative and structural analysis showed that 350VYAWN354 was a highly conserved epitope and exposed on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, whereas 473YQAGSTP479 located in the receptor binding motif (RBM) was variable among different SARS-CoV-2 strains. 407VRQIAP412 was a highly conserved, but cryptic epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. These findings provide important information for understanding the humoral antibody response to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and may facilitate further efforts to design SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the target of COVID-19 diagnostic. © Copyright © 2021 Jiang, Zhang, Liu, Ding, Liu, Tian, Wang and Wang.","epitope; monoclonal antibody; RBD; SARS-CoV-2; spike protein","Amino Acid Motifs; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; B-Lymphocytes; Conserved Sequence; COVID-19 Vaccines; Epitope Mapping; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Peptides; Protein Binding; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; cross reacting antibody; epitope; immunoglobulin G antibody; monoclonal antibody; recombinant protein; virus antigen; epitope; neutralizing antibody; peptide; protein binding; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody production; antibody response; antibody titer; Article; conserved sequence; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epitope mapping; female; fluorescence microscopy; gene mutation; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; humoral immunity; immunization; immunofluorescence assay; immunogenicity; mouse; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; polymerase chain reaction; receptor binding; RNA extraction; SARS coronavirus; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line; structure analysis; vaccination; virus neutralization; Western blotting; B lymphocyte; epitope mapping; genetics; HEK293 cell line; immunology; metabolism; protein motif"

Vaccines are among the most effective public health tools for combating COVID-19. Immune status is critical for evaluating the safety and response to the vaccine, however, the evolution of the immune response during immunization remains poorly understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) represents a powerful tool for dissecting multicellular behavior and discovering therapeutic antibodies. Herein, by performing scRNA/V(D)J-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four COVID-19 vaccine trial participants longitudinally during immunization, we revealed enhanced cellular immunity with concerted and cell type-specific IFN responses as well as boosted humoral immunity with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Based on the CDR3 sequence and germline enrichment, we were able to identify several potential binding antibodies. We synthesized, expressed and tested 21 clones from the identified lineages. Among them, one monoclonal antibody (P3V6-1) exhibited relatively high affinity with the extracellular domain of Spike protein, which might be a promising therapeutic reagent for COVID-19. Overall, our findings provide insights for assessing vaccine through the novel scRNA/V(D)J-seq approach, which might facilitate the development of more potent, durable and safe prophylactic vaccines. © 2021, The Author(s).","",""

There was a reduction by more than half in the number of recorded pertussis cases, from 1,629 in 2019 to 753 in 2020. Pertussis is most dangerous for young children, however, it can get sick at any age, and the disease does not leave permanent immunity. Severe pertussis can also develop in the elderly, which may increase the risk of mortality. Adults usually have pertussis is mildly symptomatic and constitute an important reservoir of B. pertussis. The most effective strategy for the prevention of pertussis is still immunization of children in accordance with the Protective Vaccination Program, and in the case of adults, vaccination with the pertussis component in acellular form, repeated regularly every 10 years. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the epidemiological situation of pertussis in Poland in 2020 compared to the situation in previous years, with particular emphasis on the assessment of the vaccination status of children against pertussis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The assessment of the epidemiological situation of pertussis in Poland was performed on the basis of the results of the analysis of unit reports of pertussis registered in the NIPH NIH - NRI in the EpiBaza system and data from the annual bulletin ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2020"" and the bulletin ""Vaccinations in Poland in 2020"". RESULTS: In 2020, 753 cases of pertussis were registered. The incidence was 1.96 per 100,000 population and was lower compared to the incidence in 2019 (4.24). The highest incidence of pertussis occurred in the age group 0-4 years (9.9), and high in children and adolescents aged 5-9 years (5.1) and 10-14 years (6.0 per 100,000 population). About half of the cases concerned people over 15 years of age. In general, a higher incidence of women was observed than that of men, as well as a greater number of cases in cities than in rural areas. In 2020, among people suffering from pertussis, 206 people (i.e. 27%) required hospitalization. In 2020, one fatal case of the disease was reported to the epidemiological surveillance system. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: In Poland, in 2020, there was a decrease in the number of pertussis cases by more than a half compared to the previous year. Despite the decline in disease rates, pertussis remains a public health problem as immunization-induced immunity is not sustained throughout life. Increasing the number of people susceptible to pertussis may lead to compensatory epidemics in the future, therefore the highest possible level of vaccination of the population, >92-94%, should be maintained to prevent new cases of pertussis. © National Institute of Public Health NIH – National Research Institute.","2020; epidemiology; infectious diseases; pertussis; Poland","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Communicable Diseases; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Poland; Registries; Rural Population; SARS-CoV-2; Urban Population; Whooping Cough; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; child; communicable disease; epidemic; female; human; incidence; infant; male; pertussis; Poland; preschool child; register; rural population; urban population"

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China which then started spreading to different countries around the world. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors are present in various organs but the overexpression of ACE2 at lung epithelia makes them more vulnerable to respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors for entry into host cells which may serve as potential target for future therapy .Repurposing of drugs are the present strategy undertaken as the SARS-CoV-2 shows similar respiratory distress symptoms as in the case of SARS and MERS. At present the antiviral medications and vaccines are at the early stages and may take few months to years, to achieve their complete efficacy to solve the public crisis. The technological advancements have brought passive immunisation, which is an anecdotal success, but the ideal approach to future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 is done by vaccines that are under clinical trials. There are a large percentage of population under psychological crisis either due to the fear of infection or stress from the quarantine lives. High levels of viral loads at the initial stages cause higher chances of transmission hence immediate isolations and screening methods must be undertaken. This review mainly focuses on the treatment strategies followed with no definitive approval from authorities. This is an attempt to gather all the materialistic evidences available for now. © 2022 The Author (s).","ACE2 receptors; Antiviral therapy; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Drug repurposing; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines","ad 5ncov; advac; alpha2b interferon plus ribavirin; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; atazanavir; camostat mesilate; chloroquine; chlorpromazine; cobicistat; convidicea; coronavac; covaxin; darunavir; elasomeran; favipiravir; gam covid vac; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; ivermectin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; mrna 1273; nitazoxanide; nvx-cov2373 vaccine; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; sofosbuvir; sputnik v vaccine; teicoplanin; telbivudine; tocilizumab; umifenovir; virus RNA; zinc; antiviral therapy; autopsy; coronavirus disease 2019; drug repositioning; histology; human; immune response; incubation time; mucosal immunity; nonhuman; pandemic; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus genome; virus pathogenesis"

After 10 months of restrictive measures and media coverage of the dangers of COVID-19, French attitudes towards a vaccine continue to deteriorate. The communication strategies of the government have not helped; in fact, they have made the situation worse. Empirical studies on the national strategy for management of the COVID-19 pandemic in France have shed light on the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. These studies have identified four pillars for the vaccination strategy: i) Communication regarding the importance of herd immunity, ii) making healthcare workers the focus of the vaccination campaign, iii) citizen mobilization and guaranteed consultations, and iv) access to free vaccines without delay. This paper discusses the evidence supporting this strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Covid-19; France; Models; Vaccine hesitancy","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; France; Humans; Immunization Programs; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccination Hesitancy; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; consultation; coronavirus disease 2019; France; health care access; health care personnel; health program; herd immunity; human; Note; pandemic; public health campaign; public health message; theoretical model; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; France; preventive health service"

The relative magnitude and duration of infection and vaccine-derived protection, alone and together, can guide public health planning and epidemic forecasting. To examine the impact of primary COVID-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates, statewide testing, surveillance, and COVID-19 immunization data from California and New York (which account for 18% of the U.S. population) were analyzed. Four cohorts of adults aged ≥18 years were considered: persons who were 1) unvaccinated with no previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 2) vaccinated (14 days after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 3) unvaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 4) vaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Age-adjusted hazard rates of incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in both states were compared among cohorts, and in California, hospitalizations during May 30–November 20, 2021, were also compared. During the study period, COVID-19 incidence in both states was highest among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis compared with that among the other three groups. During the week beginning May 30, 2021, compared with COVID-19 case rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 case rates were 19.9-fold (California) and 18.4-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis; 7.2-fold (California) and 9.9-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; and 9.6-fold (California) and 8.5-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These relationships changed after the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant (i.e., accounted for >50% of sequenced isolates) in late June and July. By the week beginning October 3, compared with COVID-19 cases rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, case rates among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were 6.2-fold (California) and 4.5-fold (New York) lower; rates were substantially lower among both groups with previous COVID-19 diagnoses, including 29.0-fold (California) and 14.7-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis, and 32.5-fold (California) and 19.8-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These results demonstrate that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization, and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection and related hospitalization. Importantly, infection-derived protection was higher after the Delta variant became predominant, a time when vaccine-induced immunity for many persons declined because of immune evasion and immunologic waning (2,5,6). Similar cohort data accounting for booster doses needs to be assessed, as new variants, including Omicron, circulate. Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 might change with the emergence of new variants, vaccination remains the safest strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated complications; all eligible persons should be up to date with COVID-19 vaccination. Additional recommendations for vaccine doses might be warranted in the future as the virus and immunity levels change © 2022, MMWR Recommendations and Reports.

However, there are very few peer-reviewed studies describing its effects. Independent reports regarding safety and effectiveness could accelerate the final approval by the WHO. We aimed to study the long-term humoral immune response in naïve and previously infected volunteers who received SPUTNIK V. Methods: Humoral immune responses, assayed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike-RBD IgG ELISA and neutralization assays, were measured in 602 healthcare workers at 0, 14, 28, 60 and 180 days after receiving SPUTNIK V between December 2020 and July 2021 in Tucumán, Argentina. Findings: Seroconversion was detected in 97% of individuals after 28 days post-vaccination (dpv) (N = 405). Anti-RBD titers began to decrease after 60 dpv (N = 328), but remained detectable in 94% at 90 dpv (N = 224). At 180 dpv, anti-RDB titers persisted in 31% (N = 146). Previous infection triggered an increased immune response to the first dose and increased neutralization activity against variants of concern (VOC). Second doses in previously infected individuals further increased titers, even 90 dpv (N = 75). Basal antibody titers had more influence on post-vaccination anti-RBD responses than the time elapsed between diagnosis and vaccination (N = 274). Interpretation: Data presented herein provides essential knowledge regarding the kinetics of antibodies induced by SPUTNIK V up to six months after immunization, and suggests that when considering one-dose vaccination policies for individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, serological studies to determine basal titers may be important, independent of when diagnosis occurred.

For this reason, understanding the social psychological variables associated with vaccination intent is essential to achieve herd immunity. Drawing on the theory of reasoned action, this study seeks to analyze vaccination intent using the beliefs about vaccine effectiveness, conspiracy theories, and injunctive norms as predictors. A non-probabilistic national online survey was conducted during December 2020. A sample of 1,033 people in Chile answered a questionnaire with the study variables. Using structural equation models, it was found that vaccination intent was explained in 62.1% by beliefs about vaccine effectiveness and injunctive norms, controlling for age, political orientation, socioeconomic status, educational level, and gender. Specifically, beliefs about vaccine effectiveness are based on people's experience with previous immunization processes, which predict vaccination intent. Regarding injunctive norms, they act by influencing and encouraging vaccination by seeking the approval of significant others. Contrary to expected, conspiracy beliefs were not directly associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but were highly related to lower beliefs about vaccine effectiveness. This study suggests that to enhance the vaccination intent, socio-psychological and structural variables need to be considered. © The Author(s) 2021.","beliefs; conspiracy theories; infection diseases; public health; vaccination intent; vaccine hesitancy",""

Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and binary logistic regression. Results: Mostly positive opinion about vaccination was revealed among Croatian biology students, while 67.3% expressed willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccine compliance was not associated with gender, level of education or University they attended. However, opinion about safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, perceiving vaccination as important for stopping current pandemic and feeling exposed to COVID-19 infection significantly affected the odds for accepting COVID-19 vaccine. Many students were aware of the opportunity to influence vaccination decisions of the next generations by providing knowledge regarding infectious diseases, immunity and vaccines as future biology teachers. Conclusions: Increasing willingness and competence of biology students and biology teachers to promote vaccine-positive attitudes could be promising long-term strategy for decreasing vaccine hesitancy. © 2021, Croatian Society of Natural Sciences.

COVID-19 genome (SARS-CoV-2) is related to other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). Amino acid substitutions in some of SARS-CoV-2 proteins resulted in mutations proposing more virulent and contagious properties for this novel virus. Coronavirus penetrates the host cell via endocytosis and once infected, immune responses are triggered to fight against the pathogen. Innate immune response activates major transcription factors to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon response (T1INF) to induce antiviral immunity. While adaptive immunity initiates cascade of B-cells antibody mediated and T-cells cellular mediate immunities, several mechanisms are raised by SARS-CoV-2 to evade host immune response. Consequently, a surge of proinflammatory cytokines, known as cytokine storm (CS) are released. Failure to manage CS results in several pathological complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although researches have not discovered an effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2, recent therapeutic approaches recommending the use of anti-inflammatories in combination with antivirals and some repurposed drugs for COVID-19 patients. Future medications should be designed to target essential hallmarks in the CS to improve clinical outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.","COVID-19; cytokine storm; immune response; inflammation; therapy","anticoagulant agent; antivirus agent; interferon; adaptive immunity; adult respiratory distress syndrome; alternative medicine; amino acid substitution; antiviral activity; blood clotting; cellular immunity; clinical outcome; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine storm; disease transmission; endocytosis; genetic variability; human; immune evasion; immune response; immunization; immunotherapy; inflammation; innate immunity; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; pandemic; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; vaccination; vascular disease; virus entry; virus genome; virus immunity; virus mutation; virus replication; virus transmission"

Vaccine hesitance causes severe outcomes, and is the phenomenon emerges with the process of vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy lead to the diseases those have already been eliminated or well under controlled comeback or escalate into outbreak. Since the vaccine hesitancy impact continues to increase in recent years, vaccine hesitancy has been ranked one of the top ten global threats to human health. And now vaccine hesitancy is also the key barrier during the COVID-19 pandemic in controlling the disease globally and domestically by massively vaccinating. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the growing hesitancy is real, and reminds us that it cannot work if people refuse to be vaccinated, the herd immunity cannot be achieved, and there is limited chance to control the domestic sporadic epidemic and international imported risks. Vaccine hesitancy has complicated reasons, majorly categorized into vaccine confidence, including evaluation on safety and efficacy; complacency, including the underestimated disease burden and overconfidence on controlling the highly contagious disease; and convenience, including vaccine experimenting, producing, vaccinating and price.

The immunization programs have helped to increase life expectancy, reduce parental fears of life-threatening childhood diseases, eradication of certain destructive epidemics from the community, and pecuniary savings by prevention of disabilities and diseases. Different types of vaccines are currently in use against various life-threatening diseases and those which have the potential of emerging in previously unaffected regions of the world. For certain globally infectious diseases like Yellow Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, Dengue, Influenza, Pneumonia, Rotaviral Gastroenteritis and Hepatitis B, effective human vaccines have already been developed, while for Gonorrhoea, Melioidosis and Tuberculosis (apart from the BCG vaccine) several effective vaccines are in development. Research advancements and most modern technologies are being applied in the development of several modern vaccines through the support of proteomics, genomics, comparative genomics, structural vaccinology, transcriptomics, mRNA based technologies and most recently vaccinomics. The rate of vaccine refusal or delay has been reported to increase in developed countries due to several reasons, leading to variation in vaccine coverage rates and reemergence of vaccinepreventable diseases. Use of combination vaccines increases vaccination rates, provide better coverage and timeliness of vaccination, improve the efficiency of healthcare practice, and reduce costs for the healthcare system. Veterinary vaccines are important for animal health and welfare, food production and public health by preventing animal diseases, reducing transmission of zoonotic and food borne infections to people and finally by enhancing the efficiency of food production. According to WHO, the pandemic COVID-19 is a serious threat to our health and well-being. Recently different countries have developed and are still developing several vaccines in order to combat this lifethreatening disease. Currently, while widespread vaccination is the only strategy that is effective in preventing the transmission of COVID-19, questions remain about the degree and duration of protection that will be offered from the COVID-19 vaccines. Recent studies report the emergence of an anti-vaccination culture among public and its spread through social media, which consequently may result in reduction of herd immunity and the spread of infectious diseases. © 2022 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Childhood vaccines; COVID-19; Modern vaccines; Pandemic; Public health; Vaccines",""

Concerns include potential side effects caused by the antigen itself and safety of viral DNA and RNA delivery vectors. The large SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates but can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, which might cause vaccination-induced complications or enhancement of COVID-19 disease. Besides, encoding of a functional S in replication-competent virus vector vaccines may result in the emergence of viruses with altered or expanded tropism. Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine complemented with VSV G, VSVΔG-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients, and protected transgenic K18-hACE2 mice from COVID-19-like disease. Homologous boost immunization further enhanced virus neutralizing activity. The results demonstrate that non-spreading rhabdovirus RNA replicons expressing minispike proteins represent effective and safe alternatives to vaccination approaches using replication-competent viruses and/or the entire S antigen. © 2021 Hennrich et al.

Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines.

Influenza virus has frequent antigenic drifts that can facilitate escape from pre-existing population immunity and lead to rapid and widespread transmission. Seasonal influenza is characterized by annual epidemics and outbreaks in places of public gathering such as schools, kindergartens, and nursing homes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal influenza causes 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290 000 to 650 000 deaths globally each year. Pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and persons with chronic medical conditions are at highest risk for severe illness and death from influenza virus infection. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 may co-circulate with influenza and other respiratory viruses in the upcoming winter-spring influenza season. Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and complications from influenza. China has several licensed influenza vaccines - trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3), which include split-virus influenza vaccine and subunit vaccine; quadrivalent split-virus inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4); and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3). With the exception of a few major cities, influenza vaccine is a non-program vaccine, which means that influenza vaccination is not included in China's Expanded Program on Immunization, and recipients must pay for influenza vaccine and its administration. China CDC has issued ""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China"" every year from 2018 to 2020. This past year, there have been scientific and programmatic advances in prevention and control of seasonal influenza. To strengthen technical guidance for prevention and control of influenza and facilitate operational research on influenza vaccination, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccination Technical Working Group (TWG) updated the 2020-2021 technical guidelines into the ""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China (2021-2022)."" The new version has updates in five key areas: (1) new research evidence, especially from studies in China, on disease burden, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine-avoidable disease burden, vaccine safety monitoring, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses, (2) policies and measures for influenza prevention and control that were issued by National Health Commission (NHC) in the past year, (3) licensure of a new seasonal influenza vaccine in time for the 2021-2022 season, (4) composition of the northern hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines for the 2021-2022 season, and (5) recommendations for influenza vaccination during the 2021-2022 influenza season. The recommendations specify that immunization clinics should provide influenza vaccine to all persons aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and do not have contraindications; the interval between receipt of influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine should at least 14 days; and there is no preference for one influenza vaccine over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate vaccine is available. Considering the global COVID-19 pandemic and the need to decrease risk of influenza virus infection and minimize potential impact on COVID-19 prevention and control, we recommend the following target population priorities in preparation for the 2021-2022 influenza season: (1) healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, and quarantine professionals, (2) volunteers and staff who provide service and support for large events, (3) people living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staff who take care of vulnerable, at-risk individuals, (4) people who work in high population density settings, including teachers and students in kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools and prisoners and prison staff, and (5) people with high risk of complications from influenza, including adults ≥60 years of age, children 6-59 months of age, persons with certain chronic conditions, family members and caregivers of infants <6 months of age, and pregnant women and women who plan to become pregnant during the influenza season. Children 6 months through 8 years of age who have never received influenza vaccine or who have received only one lifetime dose require 2 doses of influenza vaccine that are administered at least 4 weeks apart. This recommendation applies to both IIV and LAIV. If children received 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the 2020-2021 influenza season or received more than 2 doses of influenza vaccine in prior influenza seasons, 1 dose of influenza vaccine is recommended. People more than 9 years old require only 1 dose of influenza vaccine. People should receive influenza vaccination by the end of October, and influenza vaccine should be offered as soon as it is available. For people unable to be vaccinated before the end of October, influenza vaccine will continue to be offered throughout the season. Influenza vaccine is recommended for pregnant women during any trimester of pregnancy. These guidelines are intended for use by staff of CDCs at all levels who work on influenza control and prevention; immunization clinic staff members; healthcare workers from departments of pediatrics, internal medicine, and infectious diseases; and staff of maternity and child care institutions at all levels. The guidelines will be periodically updated as new evidence becomes available. © 2021 Chinese Medical Association.

In this scoping review we aimed to systematically collect the evidence on 1) the impact of common infections such as influenza, pneumonia and varicella zoster on frailty development, and 2) the role played by frailty in the response to immunization of older adults. Findings are discussed under a unifying framework to identify knowledge gaps and outline their clinical and public health implications to foster a healthier aging. Twenty-nine studies (113,863 participants) selected to answer the first question provided a moderately strong evidence of an association between infections and physical as well as cognitive decline – two essential dimensions of frailty. Thirteen studies (34,520 participants) investigating the second aim, showed that frailty was associated with an impaired immune response in older ages, likely due to immunosenescence. However, the paucity of studies, the absence of tools to predict vaccine efficacy, and the lack of studies investigating the efficacy of newer vaccines in presence of frailty, strongly limit the formulation of more personalized immunization strategies for older adults. The current evidence suggests that infections and frailty repeatedly cross each other pathophysiological paths and accelerate the aging process in a vicious circle. Such evidence opens to several considerations. First, the prevention of both conditions pass through a life course approach, which includes several individual and societal aspects. Second, the maintenance of a well-functioning immune system may be accomplished by preventing frailty, and vice versa. Third, increasing the adherence to immunization may delay the onset of frailty and maintain the immune system homeostasis, beyond preventing infections. © 2021 The Author(s)","Frailty; Healthy aging; Immunosenescence; Vaccination","Aged; COVID-19; Frailty; Healthy Aging; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; influenza vaccine; varicella zoster vaccine; aging; bacterial infection; chickenpox; cognition; cognitive defect; conceptual framework; disease association; drug efficacy; evidence based practice; frailty; healthy aging; herpes zoster; human; immune response; immune system; immunity; immunization; immunosenescence; influenza; innate immunity; knowledge; life; physical activity; pneumonia; primary prevention; public health; quality of life; Review; senescence; society; vaccination; Varicella zoster virus; virus infection; aged; frailty; middle aged; pandemic"

Vaccine development has represented a step towards the desired herd immunity in a short period of time, owing to a high level of investment, the focus of researchers, and the urge for the authorization of the faster administration of vaccines. Nevertheless, this objective may only be achieved by pursuing effective strategies and policies in various countries worldwide. In the present review, some aspects involved in accomplishing a successful vaccination program are addressed, in addition to the importance of vaccination in a pandemic in the face of unwillingness, conspiracy theories, or a lack of information among the public. Moreover, we provide some updated points related to the landscape of the clinical development of vaccine candidates, specifically, the top five vaccines that are already being assessed in Phase IV clinical trials (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222, Ad26.COV2.S, and CoronaVac). © 2021 by the authors.

They represent a key countermeasure to limit epidemics caused by emerging infectious diseases. The Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa dramatically revealed the need for a rapid and strategic development of vaccines to effectively control outbreaks. Seven years later, in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this need has never been as urgent as it is today. Vaccine development and implementation of clinical trials have been greatly accelerated, but still lack strategic design and evaluation. Responses to vaccination can vary widely across individuals based on factors like age, microbiome, co-morbidities and sex. The latter aspect has received more and more attention in recent years and a growing body of data provide evidence that sex-specific effects may lead to different outcomes of vaccine safety and efficacy. As these differences might have a significant impact on the resulting optimal vaccine regimen, sex-based differences should already be considered and investigated in pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this Review, we will highlight the clinical observations of sex-specific differences in response to vaccination, delineate sex differences in immune mechanisms, and will discuss the possible resulting implications for development of vaccine candidates against emerging infections. As multiple vaccine candidates against COVID-19 that target the same antigen are tested, vaccine development may undergo a decisive change, since we now have the opportunity to better understand mechanisms that influence vaccine-induced reactogenicity and effectiveness of different vaccines. © Copyright © 2021 Fathi, Addo and Dahlke.","emerging infections; genetic; hormones; miRNAs; sex differences; vaccine; X-chromosome inactivation; X-linked gene products","Animals; COVID-19; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Immunity; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Sex Characteristics; Vaccination; Viral Vaccines; CD4 antigen; CD40 antigen; gamma interferon; influenza vaccine; interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; malaria vaccine; measles vaccine; neutralizing antibody; smallpox vaccine; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; vaccine; virus vaccine; adaptive immunity; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; communicable disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotoxicity; drug development; drug safety; Ebolavirus; epigenetics; gene expression; genetics; immune response; immunity; immunization; immunogenicity; immunomodulation; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; pandemic; Review; sex difference; T lymphocyte; vaccination; Vaccinia virus; virus infection; virus replication; Wart virus; animal; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; human; immunity; immunology; pandemic; procedures; sexual characteristics"

In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis. Our findings suggest that a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions without fully suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will lead to extensive viral spread, resulting in a high disease burden even in the presence of vaccines that reduce risk of infection and mortality. Our modeling points to the feasibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 suppression with high population-level compliance and vaccines that are highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, vaccine-mediated reduction of transmission is critical for viral suppression, and in order for partially-effective vaccines to play a positive role in SARS-CoV-2 suppression, complementary biomedical interventions and public health measures must be deployed simultaneously. © 2021 Stoddard et al.

Independent (non-sponsored) studies have a great potential to enhance public confidence in vaccines and accelerate their uptake process. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional study for the side effects (SE) of CoronaVac was carried out in February 2021 among Turkish healthcare workers who were recently vaccinated. The questionnaire inquired about local and systemic SEs that occurred in the short-term, within four weeks, following vaccination. Results: A total of 780 healthcare workers were included in this study; 62.5% of them experienced at least one SE. Injection site pain (41.5%) was the most common local SE, while fatigue (23.6%), headache (18.7%), muscle pain (11.2%) and joint pain (5.9%) were the common systemic SEs. Female healthcare workers (67.9%) were significantly more affected by local and systemic SEs than male colleagues (51.4%). Younger age, previous infection, and compromised health status (chronic illnesses and regular medicines uptake) can be associated with an increased risk of CoronaVac SEs; Conclusions: The independent research shows a higher prevalence of CoronaVac SEs than what is reported by phase I–III clinical trials.

We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at population level in Wuhan to inform the development of vaccination strategies. Methods: In this longitudinal cross-sectional study, we used a multistage, population-stratified, cluster random sampling method to systematically select 100 communities from the 13 districts of Wuhan. Households were systematically selected from each community and all family members were invited to community health-care centres to participate. Eligible individuals were those who had lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since Dec 1, 2019. All eligible participants who consented to participate completed a standardised electronic questionnaire of demographic and clinical questions and self-reported any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or previous diagnosis of COVID-19. A venous blood sample was taken for immunological testing on April 14–15, 2020. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. We did two successive follow-ups between June 11 and June 13, and between Oct 9 and Dec 5, 2020, at which blood samples were taken. Findings: Of 4600 households randomly selected, 3599 families (78·2%) with 9702 individuals attended the baseline visit. 9542 individuals from 3556 families had sufficient samples for analyses. 532 (5·6%) of 9542 participants were positive for pan-immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2, with a baseline adjusted seroprevalence of 6·92% (95% CI 6·41–7·43) in the population. 437 (82·1%) of 532 participants who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins were asymptomatic. 69 (13·0%) of 532 individuals were positive for IgM antibodies, 84 (15·8%) were positive for IgA antibodies, 532 (100%) were positive for IgG antibodies, and 212 (39·8%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at baseline. The proportion of individuals who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins who had neutralising antibodies in April remained stable for the two follow-up visits (162 [44·6%] of 363 in June, 2020, and 187 [41·2%] of 454 in October–December, 2020). On the basis of data from 335 individuals who attended all three follow-up visits and who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins, neutralising antibody levels did not significantly decrease over the study period (median 1/5·6 [IQR 1/2·0 to 1/14·0] at baseline vs 1/5·6 [1/4·0 to 1/11·2] at first follow-up [p=1·0] and 1/6·3 [1/2·0 to 1/12·6] at second follow-up [p=0·29]). However, neutralising antibody titres were lower in asymptomatic individuals than in confirmed cases and symptomatic individuals. Although titres of IgG decreased over time, the proportion of individuals who had IgG antibodies did not decrease substantially (from 30 [100%] of 30 at baseline to 26 [89·7%] of 29 at second follow-up among confirmed cases, 65 [100%] of 65 at baseline to 58 [92·1%] of 63 at second follow-up among symptomatic individuals, and 437 [100%] of 437 at baseline to 329 [90·9%] of 362 at second follow-up among asymptomatic individuals). Interpretation: 6·92% of a cross-sectional sample of the population of Wuhan developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 39·8% of this population seroconverting to have neutralising antibodies. Our durability data on humoral responses indicate that mass vaccination is needed to effect herd protection to prevent the resurgence of the epidemic.

The rapid global spread of COVID-19 is attributed to the increased human mobility of today’s world, yet the threat of viral infections to global public health is expected to increase continuously in part due to increasing human– animal interface. Development of antiviral agents is crucial to combat both existing and novel viral infections. Recently, there is a growing interest in peptide/protein-based drug molecules. Antibodies are becoming especially predominant in the drug market. Indeed, in a remarkably short period, four antibody therapeutics were authorized for emergency use in COVID-19 treatment in the US, Russia, and India as of November 2020. Phage display has been one of the most widely used screening methods for peptide/antibody drug discovery. Several phage display-derived biologics are already in the market, and the expiration of intellectual property rights of phage-display antibody discovery platforms suggests an increment in antibody drugs in the near future. This review summarizes the most common phage display libraries used in antiviral discovery, highlights the approaches employed to enhance the antiviral potency of selected peptides/antibody fragments, and finally provides a discussion about the present status of the developed antivirals in clinic. © 2021 by the authors.

Currently, the demand for first and second COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as the COVID-19 booster, continues to fluctuate in the U.S. population as COVID-19 variants continue to emerge. This hesitancy has resulted in a stalled vaccination program and the absence of herd immunity. To support the successful management of a vaccine program, we recommend public health education and communication measures that can be tailored to local community needs while preparing realistic public expectations surrounding the efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine. A tailored approach may reduce vaccine hesitancy in American society. The perspectives offered herein present a pathway that is applicable to the current COVID-19 vaccine management program in the U.S., other global locations, and future pandemics.  © Caron and Dorsey.","Compliance; COVID-19; Distribution; Safety; Vaccine",""

Several vaccine trial designs may significantly accelerate vaccine testing and approval, but also increase risks to human subjects. Concerns about whether the public would see such designs as ethical represent an important roadblock to their implementation; accordingly, both the World Health Organization and numerous scholars have called for consulting the public regarding them. We answered these calls by conducting a cross-national survey (n = 5920) in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The survey explained key differences between traditional vaccine trials and two accelerated designs: a challenge trial or a trial integrating a Phase II safety and immunogenicity trial into a larger Phase III efficacy trial. Respondents’ answers to comprehension questions indicate that they largely understood the key differences and ethical trade-offs between the designs from our descriptions. We asked respondents whether they would prefer scientists to conduct traditional trials or one of these two accelerated designs. We found broad majorities prefer for scientists to conduct challenge trials (75%) and integrated trials (63%) over standard trials. Even as respondents acknowledged the risks, they perceived both accelerated trials as similarly ethical to standard trial designs. This high support is consistent across every geography and demographic subgroup we examined, including vulnerable populations. These findings may help assuage some of the concerns surrounding accelerated designs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Challenge trials; COVID-19; Public opinion; Vaccine ethics","Asia; Australia; Choice Behavior; Clinical Trials as Topic; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunization Schedule; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Male; North America; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Public Health; Research Design; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; United Kingdom; Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; Australia; Canada; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; demography; drug efficacy; drug research; drug safety; geography; health survey; Hong Kong; human; immunogenicity; medical ethics; New Zealand; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; public opinion; scientist; Singapore; South Africa; study design; United Kingdom; United States; vulnerable population; administration and dosage; Asia; biosynthesis; clinical trial (topic); decision making; drug effect; epidemiology; female; immunization; immunology; innate immunity; male; methodology; North America; pandemic; pathogenicity; patient safety; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; public health; questionnaire; time factor; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; virology"

Most African countries had a delay in the initiation of their COVID-19 vaccine national rollout compared to other regions in the world, and the goal of the immunization exercise in the continent is to vaccinate over 60% of the African population to attain herd immunity. Over the years, vaccination programmes are usually faced with challenges in Africa because of numerous factors. So far, some of the major challenges threatening the success of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in most African countries includes the slow onset of the vaccination exercise, limited funds, concerns around vaccine safety and uncertainties, storage requirements and regulatory hurdles for vaccines, limited shelf life of COVID-19 vaccines, inability to access vulnerable communities in a timely fashion, problems around the use of different vaccines, and wars and conflicts. The solutions and other imperative recommendations to these challenges were provided so as to optimize the vaccination programme and to achieve an appreciable success in the COVID-19 vaccination programme on the continent. In conclusion, a holistic and timely planning, fast execution of plans, rigorous community involvement, and a robust multi-sectoral partnership will ensure a successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Africa. © GERMS 2021.","Africa; Challenges; COVID-19; Solutions; Vaccination","comirnaty; elasomeran; vaxzevria; Africa; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; drug storage; human; immunization; infection control; pandemic; public health campaign; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shelf life; vaccination; vulnerable population"

However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication—including uncertainty—about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g., social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy.

The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination. © 2021 by the authors.

SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 215 countries and infected many millions of people. Despite the introduction of numerous governmental and public health measures to control disease spread, infections continue at an unabated pace, suggesting that effective vaccines and antiviral drugs will be required to curtail disease, end the pandemic, and restore societal norms.

We compare childhood vaccine uptake in three types of healthcare facilities in Singapore - public primary care clinics, a hospital paediatric unit, and private paediatrician clinics - from January to April 2020, to baseline, and calculate the impact on herd immunity for measles. We find a 25.6% to 73.6% drop in Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) uptake rates, 0.4 – 10.3% drop for Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis-inactivated Polio-Haemophilus influenza (5-in-1), and 8.0–67.8% drop for Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) across all 3 sites. Consequent herd immunity reduces to 74–84% among 12-month- to 2-year-olds, well below the 95% coverage that is protective for measles. This puts the whole community at risk for a measles epidemic.

They are perceived as the opinion leaders within their communities; therefore, their health-related beliefs and attitudes are deemed important for public health campaigns. This study aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy drivers among university students in the Czech Republic. Methods: a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out in the weeks before the unrestricted vaccine deployment to Czech adults. The questionnaire had 21 multiple-choice items stratified in 4 categories; demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related anamnesis and influenza vaccine experience, attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, and the possible drivers of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy suggested by the WHO-SAGE. Results: out of the 1351 included students, 66.8% were females, 84.5% were Czech nationals, and 40.6% enrolled in healthcare programs. The overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance level was 73.3%, 19.3% of participants were vaccine-resistant, and only 7.4% were vaccine-hesitant. Trust in the pharmaceutical industry, trust in healthcare providers, and perceived knowledge sufficiency predicted higher odds of vaccine acceptance. In contrast, media and social media, personal beliefs, immunity misconception, previous COVID-19 infection, and suspicions about novel vaccines and the local availability predicted higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: The findings of this study predict a fair probability to achieve community immunity (herd immunity) among the target population group. The primary prevention strategies in the Czech Republic need to be culturally sensitive and inclusive for foreign nationals. As one-quarter of the participating students are dependent on vaccine safety data, this study findings support the call for independent studies evaluating the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. © 2021 by the author.

Details about the structure and number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered/vaccinated individuals from the contact layer are simultaneously transferred to the information layer. The ever-growing wealth of information that is becoming available about the COVID virus was modelled at each individual level by a simplified proxy predictor of the amount of disease spread. Each informed individual, a node in a heterogeneous graph, makes a decision about vaccination “motivated” by their benefit. The obtained results showed that disease information type, global or local, has a significant impact on an individual vaccination decision. A number of different scenarios were investigated. The scenarios showed that in the case of the stronger impact of globally broadcasted disease information, individuals tend to vaccinate in larger numbers at the same time when the infection has already spread within the population. If individuals make vaccination decisions based on locally available information, the vaccination rate is uniformly spread during infection outbreak duration. Prioritising elderly population vaccination leads to an increased number of infected cases and a higher reduction in mortality. The developed model accuracy allows the precise targeting of vaccination order depending on the individuals’ number of social contacts. Precisely targeted vaccination, combined with pre-existing immunity, and public health measures can limit the infection to isolated hotspots inside the population, as well as significantly delay and lower the infection peak. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent global events including the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic means that human encounter with viruses is increased. Cancer development in individuals with viral infection can take many years after infection, demonstrating that the involvement of viruses in cancer development is a long and complex process. This complexity emanates from individual genetic heterogeneity and the many steps involved in cancer development owing to viruses. The process of tumorigenesis is driven by the complex interaction between several viral factors and host factors leading to the creation of a tumor microenvironment (TME) that is ideal and promotes tumor formation. Viruses associated with human cancers ensure their survival and proliferation through activation of several cellular processes including inflammation, migration, and invasion, resistance to apoptosis and growth suppressors. In addition, most human oncoviruses evade immune detection and can activate signaling cascades including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, Notch and Wnt pathways associated with enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis. This expert review examines and synthesizes the multiple biological factors related to oncoviruses, and the signaling cascades activated by these viruses contributing to viral oncogenesis. In particular, I examine and review the Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomaviruses, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus in a context of cancer pathogenesis. I conclude with a future outlook on therapeutic targeting of the viruses and their associated oncogenic pathways within the TME. These anticancer strategies can be in the form of, but not limited to, antibodies and inhibitors. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","cancer epidemic; epidemiology; HBV; HCV; histopathology; HIV; molecular biomarkers; public health; sub-Saharan Africa; treatment; viral oncology","Alphapapillomavirus; Carcinogenesis; Cell Transformation, Viral; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Herpesvirus 8, Human; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasms; Papillomavirus Infections; Retroviridae; Retroviridae Infections; Sarcoma, Kaposi; Signal Transduction; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor Virus Infections; biological factor; biological marker; viral oncoprotein; virus vaccine; Wart virus vaccine; Africa south of the Sahara; apoptosis; Article; Burkitt lymphoma; cancer immunization; cancer resistance; cancer survival; cell function; cell migration; cell proliferation; episome; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; gene targeting; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; histopathology; human; Human herpesvirus 8; Human immunodeficiency virus; infection prevention; Kaposi sarcoma; liver cell carcinoma; malignant neoplasm; nonhuman; signal transduction; tumor immunity; tumor microenvironment; tumor virus; uterine cervix carcinoma; virus carcinogenesis; virus cell interaction; virus latency; virus strain; Wart virus; Wnt signaling; Alphapapillomavirus; carcinogenesis; Epstein Barr virus; Human herpesvirus 8; molecularly targeted therapy; neoplasm; papillomavirus infection; pathology; physiology; Retroviridae; retrovirus infection; tumor microenvironment; virology; virus cell transformation; virus infection"

Currently, a worldwide effort has been mounted to generate billions of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses to immunize the world’s population at record speeds. However, there is still a demand for alternative effective vaccines that rapidly confer long-term protection and rely upon cost-effective, easily scaled-up manufacturing. Here, we present a Sindbis alphavirus vector (SV), transiently expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SV.Spike), combined with the OX40 immunostimulatory antibody (αOX40) as a novel, highly effective vaccine approach. We show that SV.Spike plus αOX40 elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and a vigorous T-cell response in mice. Protein binding, immunohistochemical, and cellular infection assays all show that vaccinated mice sera inhibits spike functions. Immunophenotyping, RNA Seq transcriptome profiles, and metabolic analysis indicate a reprogramming of T cells in vaccinated mice. Activated T cells were found to mobilize to lung tissue. Most importantly, SV.Spike plus αOX40 provided robust immune protection against infection with authentic coronavirus in transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2-Tg). Finally, our immunization strategy induced strong effector memory response, potentiating protective immunity against re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results show the potential of a new Sindbis virus-based vaccine platform to counteract waning immune response, which can be used as a new candidate to combat SARS-CoV-2. Given the T-cell responses elicited, our vaccine is likely to be effective against variants that are proving challenging, as well as serve as a platform to develop a broader spectrum pancoronavirus vaccine. Similarly, the vaccine approach is likely to be applicable to other pathogens. © Copyright © 2021 Scaglione, Opp, Hurtado, Lin, Pampeno, Noval, Thannickal, Stapleford and Meruelo.","alphavirus vaccine; COVID19; SARS-CoV-2 immunity; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Sindbis virus vaccine; synergistic combination SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategy; αOX40","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Differentiation; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cricetinae; Female; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; SARS-CoV-2; Sindbis Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; T-Lymphocytes; Vaccination; ACE2 protein, human; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; differentiation antigen; neutralizing antibody; OX40Ig; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; animal; C57BL mouse; female; genetics; hamster; HEK293 cell line; human; immunology; metabolism; mouse; prevention and control; Sindbis virus; T lymphocyte; transgenic mouse; vaccination"

Design Nationwide serological study. Setting Northern Ireland, UK, May 2020-February 2021. Participants Plasma samples were collected from a diverse cohort of individuals from the general public (n=279), Northern Ireland healthcare workers (n=195), pre-pandemic blood donations and research studies (n=223) and through a convalescent plasma programme (n=183). Plasma donors (n=101) were followed with sequential samples over 11 months post-symptom onset. Main outcome measures SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma samples using Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA/IgM, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and EuroImmun IgG SARS-CoV-2 ELISA immunoassays over time. UK-RTC AbC-19 LFIA sensitivity and specificity, estimated using a three-reference standard system to establish a characterised panel of 330 positive and 488 negative SARS-CoV-2 IgG samples. Results We detected persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies for up to 10 months post-infection, across a minimum of two laboratory immunoassays. On the known positive cohort, the UK-RTC AbC-19 LFIA showed a sensitivity of 97.58% (95.28% to 98.95%) and on known negatives, showed specificity of 99.59% (98.53 % to 99.95%). Conclusions Through comprehensive analysis of a cohort of pre-pandemic and pandemic individuals, we show detectable levels of IgG antibodies, lasting over 46 weeks when assessed by EuroImmun ELISA, providing insight to antibody levels at later time points post-infection.

Several studies have linked ZIKV infection in pregnant women with the development of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities, emphasizing the need for a safe and effective vaccine to combat the spread of this disease. Preclinical studies and vaccine development efforts have largely focused on the role of humoral immunity in disease protection. Consequently, relatively little is known in regard to cellular immunity against ZIKV, although an effective vaccine will likely need to engage both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. To that end, we utilized two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to identify 90 ZIKV peptides that were naturally processed and presented on HLA class I and II molecules (HLA-A∗02:01/HLADRB1∗ 04:01) of an immortalized B cell line infected with ZIKV (strain PRVABC59). Sequence identity clustering was used to filter the number of candidate peptides prior to evaluating memory T cell recall responses in ZIKV convalescent subjects. Peptides that individually elicited broad (4 of 7 subjects) and narrow (1 of 7 subjects) T cell responses were further analyzed using a suite of predictive algorithms and in silico modeling to evaluate HLA binding and peptide structural properties. A subset of nine broadly reactive peptides was predicted to provide robust global population coverage (97.47% class I; 70.74% class II) and to possess stable structural properties amenable for vaccine formulation, highlighting the potential clinical benefit for including ZIKV T cell epitopes in experimental vaccine formulations.

The pandemic has evoked widespread collateral damage to societies and economies, and has destabilized mental health and well-being. Early in 2020, unprecedented efforts went into the development of vaccines that generate effective antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Teams developing twelve candidate vaccines, based on four platforms (messenger RNA, non-replicating viral vector, protein/virus-like particle, and inactivated virus) had initiated or announced the Phase III clinical trial stage by early November 2020, with several having received emergency use authorization in less than a year. Vaccine rollout has proceeded around the globe. Previously, we and others had proposed a target product profile (TPP) for ideal/optimal and acceptable/minimal COVID-19 vaccines. How well do these candidate vaccines stack up to a harmonized TPP? Here, we perform a comparative analysis in several categories of these candidate vaccines based on the latest available trial data and highlight the early successes as well as the hurdles and barriers yet to be overcome for ending the global COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

This novel virus originated the most challenging pandemic in this century, causing economic and social upheaval internationally. The extreme infectiousness and high mortality rates incentivized the development of vaccines to control this pandemic to prevent further morbidity and mortality. This international scenario led academic scientists, industries, and governments to work and collaborate strongly to make a portfolio of vaccines available at an unprecedented pace. Indeed, the robust collaboration between public systems and private companies led to resolutive actions for accelerating therapeutic interventions and vaccines mechanism. These strategies contributed to rapidly identifying safe and effective vaccines as quickly and efficiently as possible. Preclinical research employed animal models to develop vaccines that induce protective and long-lived immune responses. A spectrum of vaccines is worldwide under investigation in various preclinical and clinical studies to develop both individual protection and safe development of population-level herd immunity. Companies employed and developed different technological approaches for vaccines production, including inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated, non-replicating viral vector vaccines, as well as acid nucleic-based vaccines. In this view, the present narrative review provides an overview of current vaccination strategies, taking into account both preclinical studies and clinical trials in humans.

Our analysis suggests that COVID-19 will exacerbate the difficulty of achieving grand convergence targets for tuberculosis (TB), maternal mortality, and, probably, for under-5 mortality. HIV targets are likely to be met. By 2035, our analysis suggests that the public sectors of low-income countries (LICs) would only be able to finance about a third of the costs of a package of 120 essential non-COVID-19 health interventions through domestic sources, unless the country increases significantly the priority assigned to the health sector; lower middle-income countries (LMICs) would likewise only be able to finance a little less than half. The likelihood of getting back on track for reaching grand convergence and UHC will depend on (i) how quickly COVID-19 vaccines can be deployed in LICs and LMICs; (ii) how much additional public sector health financing can be mobilized from external and domestic sources; and (iii) whether countries can rapidly strengthen and focus their health delivery systems. © 2021 Mao et al.

Design Retrospective observational study. Setting This study was conducted among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Brazil. Participants We analysed all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with available vaccination information captured in Brazil's national electronic respiratory infection data system between 1 January 2020 and 23 June 2020. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were age-specific mortality rates of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without recent inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination. Results A total of 53 752 clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed. Controlling for health facility of treatment, comorbidities as well as an extensive range of sociodemographic factors, patients who received a recent influenza vaccine experienced on average 7% lower odds of needing intensive care treatment (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98), 17% lower odds of requiring invasive respiratory support (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and 16% lower odds of death (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90). Protective effects were larger when the vaccine was administered after onset of symptoms as well as among younger patients. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 with recent inactivated influenza vaccination experience significantly better health outcomes than non-vaccinated patients in Brazil. Beneficial off-target effects of influenza vaccination through trained innate immune responses seem plausible and need to be further explored. Large-scale promotion of influenza vaccines seems advisable, especially in populations at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease progression. © ","immunisation; infectious disease medicine","influenza vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; assisted ventilation; asthma; Brazil; Brazilian; cardiovascular disease; child; clinical outcome; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; educational status; female; hospital patient; human; infant; influenza; influenza vaccination; innate immunity; intensive care; invasive ventilation; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality rate; neurologic disease; newborn; obesity; observational study; pandemic; prevalence; public health; retrospective study; socioeconomics; very elderly"

In Europe, the spring outbreak (March-April) was followed by a drop in the number of cases and deaths. The disease may have evolved into a milder form. The increase in PCR-positive cases in late summer 2020 did not lead to the expected increase in hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths, based on the severity of the disease in the spring. This difference in disease severity could be due to factors independent of the virus or to the evolution of the virus. This review attempts to identify the mutations that have appeared since the beginning of the pandemic and their role in the temporal evolution of the pandemic. There are a cell and humoral type cross-reactivity in a large part of the population to common cold coronaviruses (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV-2. Evolutionarily important mutations and deletions have emerged in the SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding proteins that interact with the host immune system. In addition, one of the major mutations (in viral polymerase) is logically associated with a higher frequency of mutations throughout the genome. This frequency fluctuates over time and shows a peak at the time when the epidemic was most active. The rate of mutations in proteins involved in the relationship to the immune system continues to increase after the first outbreak. The cross-reactivity on the 1 hand and the viral mutations observed on the other hand could explain the evolution of the pandemic until the summer of 2020, partly due to the evolution of the virus in relation to the host immune system. The immunization campaign began in December 2020: concerns are emerging about a possible escape of the circulating variants vaccines in early 2021. These variants could also escape immunity acquired through infection with the 2020 strains. © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Social media use has been demonstrated to play a role in the low acceptance of vaccines. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals. Methods: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2021. We used R software to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the keywords vaccination, vaccinations, vaccine, vaccines, immunization, vaccinate, and vaccinated. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling as well as sentiment and emotion analysis using the National Research Council of Canada Emotion Lexicon. Results: Topic modeling of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840/1,499,421 tweets, 15.2%) was the most tweeted topic and remained a highly discussed topic during the majority of the period of our examination. Vaccine progress around the world became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020, when Russia approved the world's first COVID-19 vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and became the most discussed topic after the first week of January 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, the sentiment was increasingly positive in general. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, sadness, etc. The trust emotion reached its peak on November 9, 2020, when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90% effective. Conclusions: Public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the active news topics in mainstream media. The discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines compared with previous vaccines. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vac-cine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified. It is necessary to offer correct and transparent information about these vaccines to reduce the concerns and increase the trust of the population, to thereby guarantee the success of the vaccination cam-paigns. © 2021 by the authors.

The high contagiousness and mortality of COVID-19 and the complete lack of population immunity posed an extraordinary threat for global health. The aim of our research was to collect and review previous experiences on mass vaccination centers. On 4 April 2021, we developed a rapid review searching four electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar and medRxiv. From a total of 2312 papers, 15 of them were included in the current review. Among them, only one article described a COVID-19 vaccination center, all of the others referred to other vaccinations, in particular influenza. The majority were conducted in the United States, and were simulations or single-day experiences to practice a mass vaccination after bioterrorist attacks. Indeed, all of them were published after September 11 attacks. Regarding staff, timing and performance, the data were highly heterogenous. Several studies used as a model the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Results highlighted the differences around the definition, layout and management of a mass vaccination center, but some aspects can be considered as a core aspect. In light of this, we suggested a potential definition. The current review answers to the urgency of organizing a mass vaccination center during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the most important organizational aspects that should be considered in the planning. © 2021 by the authors.","COVID-19; Health planning organizations; Mass vaccination; Rapid review; Vaccines","cholera vaccine; influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; smallpox vaccine; adverse drug reaction; Article; cholera; coronavirus disease 2019; health care planning; health center; human; Influenza A virus (H1N1); influenza vaccination; mass immunization; medical assessment; meningitis; mortality; pandemic; public health campaign; seasonal influenza; typhoid fever; vaccination; work environment"

The present study aimed to examine whether the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination changed in different COVID-19 epidemic phases in China. Two consecutive surveys were conducted among Chinese adults in March (n = 2058) (severe epidemic phase) and November- December (n = 2013) (well-contained phase, right before the COVID-19 vaccine was conditionally approved) 2020, and 791 respondents were longitudinally followed-up. The attitude, acceptance, and preferences for future COVID-19 vaccination were compared between two epidemic phases. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify influencing factors of acceptance. Among the 791 respondents longitudinally followed, 91.9% in March and 88.6% of them in November- December 2020 would like to get COVID-19 vaccination in China. In March 58.3% wished to get vaccinated immediately, but the proportion declined to 23.0% in November-December 2020, because more respondents wanted to delay vaccination until the vaccine’s safety was confirmed. Similar results were found by comparing all respondents from the two cross-sectional surveys in different epidemic phases. The risk perception, attitude for the importance of vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination history, valuing doctor’s recommendations, vaccination convenience, or vaccine price in decision-making had impacts on respondents’ intention for immediate vaccination. The public acceptance for COVID-19 vaccination in China sustained at a high level in different COVID-19 epidemic phases. However, the intention of immediate vaccination declined substantially due to concerns about the vaccine’s safety. Information about vaccination safety from authoritative sources, doctor’s recommendations, and vaccination convenience were important in addressing vaccine hesitancy and promoting successful herd immunity for the general population in China. © 2021 by the authors.","Change; China; COVID-19; Phase; Vaccine acceptance","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; attitude; awareness; China; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; decision making; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug safety; economic status; educational status; female; health education; health literacy; health status; herd immunity; human; human experiment; immunization; infection risk; Internet; knowledge; Likert scale; longitudinal study; male; pandemic; patient preference; perception; public health; questionnaire; risk perception; social acceptance; social status; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; young adult"

The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major target for the COVID-19 vaccine. To quickly respond to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a nucleic acid-based vaccine is a novel option, beyond the tra-ditional inactivated virus vaccine or recombinant protein vaccine. Here, we report a DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation. The spike genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and then cloned into mammalian cell expression vectors, called pSARS-S and pSARS2-S, respectively. Spike protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after transient expression in HEK293T cells. After immunization, sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses. We found that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. We further found that pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce very high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We further analyzed SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses and found that the immune responses were biased toward Th1. Importantly, pSARS2-S immunization in hamsters could induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. These data suggest that DNA vaccination could be a promising approach for protecting against COVID-19. © 2021 Chai et al.","","Animals; Chlorocebus aethiops; COVID-19; Cricetinae; Electroporation; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mesocricetus; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Plasmids; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vaccines, DNA; Vero Cells; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; beta actin; DNA vaccine; gamma interferon; interleukin 13; interleukin 2; interleukin 5; isoflurane; neutralizing antibody; virus RNA; virus spike protein; vitronectin; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; DNA vaccine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; animal experiment; animal model; antibody blood level; antibody response; antibody titer; antigen expression; Article; binding competition; blood sampling; body weight change; cell lysate; competitive ELISA; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross protection; cytokine production; DNA sequence; electroporation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Escherichia coli; gene mutation; genetic transfection; hamster; human; humoral immunity; ID50; immune response; immunity; immunization; immunoassay; immunoblotting; immunogenicity; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plasmid; plasminogen activation; prophylaxis; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; virus load; virus neutralization; virus titration; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; C57BL mouse; Chlorocebus aethiops; genetics; HEK293 cell line; immunology; Mesocricetus; prevention and control; Vero cell line"

With the advent of several COVID-19 vaccines, the dissemination and delivery of COVID-19 immunization across the nation is of concern. Previous immunization delivery patterns may reveal important components of a comprehensive and sustainable effort to immunize everyone in the nation. METHODS The delivery of vaccinations were enumerated by provider type using 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service data and the 2013-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The delivery of these services was examined at the service, physician, and visit level. RESULTS In 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service, primary care physicians provided the largest share of services for vaccinations (46%), followed closely by mass immunizers (45%), then nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey showed that primary care physicians provided most clinical visits for vaccination (54% of all visits). CONCLUSIONS Primary care physicians have played a crucial role in delivery of vaccinations to the US population, including the elderly, between 2012-2017. These findings indicate primary care practices may be a crucial element of vaccine counseling and delivery in the upcoming COVID-19 recovery and immunization efforts in the United States. © 2021, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

National surveys assessing vaccination willingness and reports of vaccination administration by race/ethnicity indicate at least two areas that warrant attention: elevated vaccine hesitancy among African American and Latino adults, and the need to ensure equitable access to vaccination. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is not uniform within racial/ethnic minority populations; yet, given the disproportionate impact, understandable distrust, and widespread misinformation, there is an imperative to overcome challenges associated with vaccination willingness and uptake, as well as implementation and access. This Perspective discusses the complexity of drivers for each of these areas, which include individual, community, and structural factors. It also highlights two initiatives at the National Institutes of Health. One is focused on addressing misinformation and distrust through academic-community partnerships, and the other on community-engaged behavioral interventions to address the population-specific reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, support informed decision-making, and promote equitable access among populations with health disparities. For the foreseeable future, proactive and persistent efforts around COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including vaccination, will remain of paramount importance for health equity. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","African Americans; COVID-19; Latinos; racial and ethnic disparities; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Vaccine; vaccine hesitancy","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Ethnic Groups; Humans; Minority Groups; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; African American; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; ethnicity; fear; health disparity; health equity; herd immunity; human; immunization; misinformation; Note; public health; social acceptance; trust; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccination refusal; vaccine hesitancy; Willingness To Pay; ethnic group; minority group"

An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is defined as any untoward occurrence following immunization, and the majority of AEFIs are caused by protective immune responses stimulated by vaccines. Most of the reported AEFIs are not serious, and many are not immunologically mediated or even reproducible on re-exposure. However, uncommon severe allergic adverse reactions, such as anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions, can occur after vaccinations. Confirmed allergic reactions to vaccines may be caused by residual non-human protein, preservatives, or stabilizers in the vaccine formulation (also known as excipients). There are 2 main potential allergenic/immunogenic excipients in COVID-19 vaccines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate 80. PEG, also known as macrogol, is an ingredient in various laxatives and injectable formulations, such as depot steroids. Polysorbate 80 is present in various medical products, creams, ointments, lotions, and medication tablets. Contraindications to the administration of COVID-19 vaccines include a previous history of severe allergic reactions to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine or proven hypersensitivity to a vaccine component, such as PEG or polysorbate 80. Anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions following immunization can cause fear and loss of confidence in the safety of vaccines among the public. A better understanding of these events is thought to help alleviate concerns about the current COVID-19 vaccines and provide reassurance to the general population by analyzing the exact incidence of anaphylaxis and potential risk factors. COVID-19 vaccine-associated anaphylaxis could be prevented and managed by risk stratification based on our local and global experience.

Here we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on an I53-50 protein nanoparticle scaffold (hereafter designated RBD–NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing-antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques. We evaluated five adjuvants including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an α-tocopherol-containing oil-in-water emulsion; AS37, a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist adsorbed to alum; CpG1018-alum, a TLR9 agonist formulated in alum; and alum. RBD–NP immunization with AS03, CpG1018-alum, AS37 or alum induced substantial neutralizing-antibody and CD4 T cell responses, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and bronchoalveolar lavage. The neutralizing-antibody response to live virus was maintained up to 180 days after vaccination with RBD–NP in AS03 (RBD–NP-AS03), and correlated with protection from infection. RBD–NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. RBD–NP-AS03 produced a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351 whereas the group immunized with RBD–NP-AS37 produced a 16-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, suggesting differences in the breadth of the neutralizing-antibody response induced by these adjuvants.

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. Measure: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty-three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. Results: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months. Conclusion: Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health, and immunization strategies. © European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","antibody dynamics; asymptomatic; COVID-19; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2","Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Carrier State; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; guanine nucleotide binding protein; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; neutralizing antibody; proteome; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adult; antibody blood level; antibody detection; antibody response; Article; asymptomatic infection; codon; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 nucleic acid testing; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; human tissue; humoral immunity; immune response; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; protein microarray; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; Vero C1008 cell line; virus neutralization; aged; blood; diagnosis; heterozygote; immunology; procedures"

Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era. Methods: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15–64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3·5% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of £20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of £15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) – costs. Findings: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 148·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48·5–198·8) COVID-19 cases and 3·1 million (0·84–4·5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from £12·0 billion to £334·7 billion in the best-case scenario and from –£1·1 billion to £56·9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large. Interpretation: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

We outline a methodology in which both health insurance provider network data and publicly available data sources can be used to identify and plan for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinator capacity at the county level. Methods: Sendero Health Plans, Inc. provider network data, Texas State Board of Pharmacy data, US Census Bureau data, and H1N1 monovalent vaccine data were utilized to identify providers with demonstrated capacity to vaccinate the population in Travis County, Texas to achieve an estimated SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity target of 67%. Results: Within the Sendero network, 2,356 non-pharmacy providers were identified with 788 (33.4%) practicing in primary care and 1,569 (66.6%) practicing as specialists. Of the total, 686 (29.1%) provided at least one immunization between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. There are 300 pharmacies with active licenses in Travis County with 161 (53.7%) classified as community pharmacies. We estimate that 1,707,098 doses of a 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series will need to be administered within Travis County, Texas to achieve the estimated 67% herd immunity threshold to disrupt person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on 2020 census data. Conclusion: A community-based health insurance plan can use data from its provider network and public data sources to support the CDC call to action to identify SARS-CoV-2 vaccinators in the community, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and pharmacies in order to provide macro level estimates of SARS-CoV-2 administration and throughput. © Copyright © 2021 Litaker, Tamez, Durkalski and Taylor.","COVID-19; mass vaccination; SARS-CoV-2; Sendero Health Plans; vaccination; vaccinators","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Datasets as Topic; Health Personnel; Humans; Immunity, Herd; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Insurance Carriers; Insurance, Health; Mass Vaccination; Pharmacies; Primary Health Care; Texas; Vaccination Coverage; influenza vaccine; health care personnel; health insurance; herd immunity; human; immunology; Influenza A virus (H1N1); information processing; insurance; mass immunization; organization and management; pharmacy (shop); prevention and control; primary health care; Texas; vaccination coverage"

Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via the mucosal route, a therapy administered by this same route may represent a desirable approach to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is now widely accepted that genetically modified microorganisms, including probiotics, represent attractive vehicles for oral or nasal mucosal delivery of therapeutic molecules. Previous studies have shown that the mucosal administration of therapeutic molecules is able to induce an immune response mediated by specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies along with mucosal cell-mediated immune responses, which effectively concur to neutralize and eradicate infections. Therefore, advances in the modulation of mucosal immune responses, and in particular the use of probiotics as live delivery vectors, may encourage prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of genetically modified probiotics for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging trends in the ever-progressing field of vaccine development re-emphasize the contribution of adjuvants, along with optimization of codon usage (when designing a synthetic gene), expression level, and inoculation dose to elicit specific and potent protective immune re-sponses. In this review, we will highlight the existing pre-clinical and clinical information on the use of genetically modified microorganisms in control strategies against respiratory and non-respiratory viruses. In addition, we will discuss some controversial aspects of the use of genetically modified probiotics in modulating the cross-talk between mucosal delivery of therapeutics and immune system modulation. © 2021 by the authors.

Subunit vaccines can avoid potential toxicity associated with traditional whole virion-inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines; however, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines is often poor. A facile method is here reported to produce lipid nanoparticle subunit vaccines that exhibit high immunogenicity and elicit protection against influenza virus. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) immunogens are functionalized on the surface of liposomes via stable metal chelation chemistry, using a scalable advanced microfluidic mixing technology (NanoAssemblr). Immunization of mice with HA-liposomes elicits increased serum antibody titers and superior protection against highly pathogenic virus challenge compared with free HA protein. HA-liposomal vaccines display enhanced antigen deposition into germinal centers within the draining lymph nodes, driving increased HA-specific B cell, and follicular helper T cell responses. This work provides mechanistic insights into highly protective HA-liposome vaccines and informs the rational design and rapid production of next generation nanoparticle subunit vaccines. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","follicular helper T cells; germinal centers; influenza vaccines; liposomes; microfluidic mixers; nanoparticle-based vaccines","Animals; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; Germinal Center; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Hemagglutinins; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Liposomes; Mice; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; SARS-CoV-2; T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer; Diseases; Immunization; Liposomes; Mammals; Nanoparticles; T-cells; Viruses; cholesterol; hemagglutinin; immunoglobulin G; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; lipid nanoparticle; liposome; phosphatidylcholine; virus antibody; hemagglutinin; influenza vaccine; liposome; virus antibody; Follicular helper T cells; Germinal centers; Lipid nanoparticles; Liposome Vaccine; Live attenuated vaccines; Microfluidic mixing; Pathogenic virus; Serum antibody titers; animal experiment; animal model; antibody titer; antigen specificity; Article; B lymphocyte; cellular immunity; chelation; controlled study; dispersity; draining lymph node; drug design; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; drug synthesis; female; germinal center; immune response; immunogenicity; infection resistance; influenza; Influenza virus; low drug dose; microfluidic analysis; mouse; nonhuman; photon correlation spectroscopy; priority journal; Tfh cell; transmission electron microscopy; virus virulence; animal; germinal center; helper cell; human; orthomyxovirus infection; Vaccines"

However, to date, Africa has secured enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for less than 5% of its population. With widespread vaccination not on the horizon for Africa, there is a strong emphasis on non-pharmaceutical interventions which include movement restrictions (lockdowns). This general COVID-19 pandemic response of imposing lockdowns, however, neglects to factor in non-fatal consequences leading to disruption socio-economic wellbeing of the society at large. The economy in most African countries can no longer sustain lockdown restrictions. Some studies have indicated that a hard lockdown statistical value of the extra lives saved would be dwarfed by its long-term cost. At the same time not responding to the threat of the pandemic will cost lives and disrupts the social fabric.

Therefore, the individuals who are reluctant to be vaccinated or forego COVID-19 vaccination can delay the progress of overall vaccination coverage, leading to slower vaccination rates and may create obstacles in global efforts to control the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 as unvaccinated individuals can act as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and could drive further outbreaks. Vaccine hesitancy is one of the major threats that directly impact global health as it challenges our ability to eradicate infectious diseases and achieve significant herd immunity through vaccination. One of the strategies to counter vaccine hesitancy is to follow a multisectoral approach that involves the collaboration between various stakeholders, such as government, private companies, religious groups, and other agencies, to leverage the knowledge, expertise, and resources, thereby enabling the creation of longstanding public trust of vaccines. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunization Programs; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines; vaccine; human; pandemic; preventive health service; vaccination"

In this study, we developed a novel DNA vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by expressing a chimeric protein of its receptor-binding domain (RBD) fused to a 33-bp sequence (11 aa) from the hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS1 region with a W4P mutation (W4P-RBD) at the N-terminal region and evaluated its immunogenicity. In vitro transfection experiments in multiple cell lines demonstrated that W4P-RBD vs. wild-type RBD protein (W-RBD) led to enhanced production of IL-6 and TNFα at the transcription and translation levels, suggesting the adjuvant potential of N-terminal HBV preS1 sequences for DNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. W4P-RBD also led to enhanced production of IgG and IgA, which can neutralize and block SARS-CoV-2 infection in both blood sera and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from the lung in vaccinated mice. Additionally, W4P-RBD led to an enhanced T-cell-mediated cellular immune response under S1 protein stimulation. In summary, W4P-RBD led to robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated mice, highlighting its feasibility as a novel DNA vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. © Copyright © 2021 Jeong, Choi, Seo and Kim.","COVID-19; DNA vaccine; HBV preS1; Receptor-binding domain (RBD); SARS-CoV-2; W4P-RBD","Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Cell Line, Tumor; Chlorocebus aethiops; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; HEK293 Cells; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Humans; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mutation; Protein Domains; Protein Precursors; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines, DNA; Vero Cells; buffer; chimeric protein; DNA vaccine; gamma interferon; hydrochloric acid; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; ionomycin; lentivirus vector; neutralizing antibody; paraformaldehyde; penicillin derivative; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; streptomycin; tetramethylbenzidine; triton x 100; tumor necrosis factor; DNA vaccine; fusion protein; hepatitis B surface antigen; presurface protein 1, hepatitis B surface antigen; protein precursor; virus antibody; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; antibody titer; antiviral activity; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; confocal microscopy; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Escherichia coli; feasibility study; fetal bovine serum; flow cytometry; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; HEK293T cell line; Hepatitis B virus; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; humoral immunity; immune response; immunization; immunofluorescence test; immunogenicity; immunoprecipitation; in vitro gene transfer; luciferase assay; lung lavage; male; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; plaque reduction neutralization test; plasmid; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein domain; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; receptor binding; RNA extraction; vaccination; Vero C1008 cell line; virus neutralization; W4P RBD gene; Western blotting; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; Chlorocebus aethiops; genetics; HEK293 cell line; immunology; mutation; prevention and control; procedures; protein domain; tumor cell line; vaccine immunogenicity; Vero cell line; virology"

This study aimed to investigate the impact of prioritising available doses on the basis of recipient antibody status, that is by exposure status, using Qatar as an example. Methods Vaccination impact (defined as the reduction in infection incidence and the number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection or one adverse disease outcome) was assessed under different scale-up scenarios using a deterministic meta-population mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression in the presence of vaccination. Results For a vaccine that protects against infection with an efficacy of 95%, half as many vaccinations were needed to avert one infection, disease outcome or death by prioritising antibody-negative individuals for vaccination. Prioritisation by antibody status reduced incidence at a faster rate and led to faster elimination of infection and return to normalcy. Further prioritisation by age group amplified the gains of prioritisation by antibody status. Gains from prioritisation by antibody status were largest in settings where the proportion of the population already infected at the commencement of vaccination was 30%-60%. For a vaccine that only protects against disease and not infection, vaccine impact was reduced by half, whether this impact was measured in terms of averted infections or disease outcomes, but the relative gains from using antibody status to prioritise vaccination recipients were similar. Conclusions Major health and economic gains can be achieved more quickly by prioritizing those who are antibody-negative while doses of the vaccine remain in short supply.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

In ancient times, insufficient knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of TB resulted in discrimination and isolation of patients. In the Middle Ages, kings used TB as a disease to secure their political power over the citizens, while TB culturally took a romanticized form during the 19th and 20th centuries, together with a great social phobia of contagion, disease, and dying on the other hand. Stereotypes were formed around all TB victims, while society tried to understand the nature of the disease and establish a civilizational relationship with it as a health problem having numerous social implications. Modern public health measures for the control of the TB pandemic were established after the discovery of the Koch bacillus in the 19th century. The invention and mass use of the BCG vaccine, the discovery of streptomycin and isoniazid, and the new era of TB treatment, with the consequent emergence of drug resistance, coepidemic with AIDS, neglect of public health facilities and the current COVID-19 pandemics threaten many legal rights of the infected and the sick and pose new challenges in its global elimination. Numerous attempts by society over the centuries to devise preventive and therapeutic measures for TB, through different levels of social obligations and activities, have had and continue to have a profound impact on the human race, shaping its further response to the victims of this deadly disease. © 2021 Sciendo.

Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine how policies and practices against covid-19 were prioritized by health care professionals and other segments of society via AHP method. We observed that the order of importance of health care professionals and other segments of the society regarding the policies and practices used in combating the covid-19 outbreak was quite similar between the groups. The covid-19 test policy was revealed as the most important one of both groups. However, social welfare programs have more significance than economic measures for society, while health care professionals are more concerned with economic measures.

Subjects and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted by enrolling adults living in Kuwait (n = 2,368; aged ≥21 years). Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was inferred if participants indicated that they ""definitely or probably will accept vaccination against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available.""Associations were explored by applying a modified Poisson regression to estimate and infer adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In total, 53.1% (1,257/2,368) of the participants were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once available. Male subjects were more willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine than females (58.3 vs. 50.9%, p < 0.001). Subjects who viewed vaccines in general to have health-related risks were less willing to accept vaccination (aPR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.35-0.44). Moreover, participants who previously received an influenza vaccine were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (aPR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.31-1.58). Willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 increased as the self-perceived chances of contracting the infection increased (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, 53.1% of the study participants demonstrated willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We found several factors influencing the level of acceptance. Since vaccination appears to be an essential preventive measure that can halt the COVID-19 pandemic, factors relating to low vaccine acceptance need to be urgently addressed by public health strategies.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Mass vaccination is needed to achieve herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Currently, several vaccines are being inoculated on a large-scale. The willingness of COVID-19 vaccination had been well investigated in the pre-vaccination era, but no reported data in the post-vaccination era yet. Methods: We conducted a large-scale survey among industrial workers during the vaccination campaign in China. Chi-square test and rank sum test were used to identify differences for various intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression models were utilized to analyze the relationship among demographic factors, related influencing factors and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Results: A total of 23,940 industrial workers were included, 66.0% were willing to take COVID-19 vaccine, 16.6% were unwilling, and 17.4% were unsure. Participants were more likely to get vaccinated if they were male, aged 45–65, being good educated, married, or being recommended by doctors or nurses. Participants with strong risk perception of COVID-19 infection, strong confidence in COVID-19 vaccine, high attention to COVID-19 vaccine, good health status, bad health habit, and a history of vaccination within three months were also more likely to be vaccinated. Conclusions: This study calls for more attention and health-related education among industrial workers to improve their acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","attitude; COVID-19; industrial workers; vaccine; willingness","Aged; China; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Male; Mass Vaccination; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; demography; exploratory factor analysis; female; health status; herd immunity; human; immunization; industrial worker; influenza vaccination; major clinical study; male; public health; questionnaire; rank sum test; risk perception; univariate analysis; vaccination; vitamin intake; aged; China; epidemiology; mass immunization; middle aged; pandemic; prevention and control; vaccination"

The present study aimed to evaluate acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among patients attending the Oncology Clinic of University Clinical Hospital Mostar. Material/Methods: This cross-sectional observational study enrolled 364 patients with cancer from the Oncology Clinic of University Clinical Hospital Mostar during February 2021. Data were collected using a questionnaire that captured general information about the participants and their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. Results: Of the participants, 41.8% answered ""Yes"" when asked if they would take the vaccine once it becomes available, 37.6% answered ""Not sure"", and 20.6% answered ""No"". For patients in favor of vaccination, the main reasons reported were fear of getting sick (77.6%), the desire to contribute to herd immunity (57.8%), and trusting the recommendations of health professionals (57.2%). The main reasons for the patients' vaccination refusal/indecision were doubts about the results from clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines (49.1%), concerns about adverse effects (24.5%), and confusion about the various vaccine options (19.8%). The majority of participants (82.4%) stated that recommendation by their oncologist could influence their decision about vaccination. Of the participants who indicated unwillingness (refusal or indecision) to be vaccinated against COVID-19, 65.3% stated that recommendation by their oncologist could influence their decision about vaccination. Conclusions: The findings from the present study showed most patients had refused or were indecisive regarding immunization with COVID-19 vaccine. Increasing physician awareness of this situation may result in higher rates of vaccination. © 2021 International Scientific Information, Inc..

Since its appearance, COVID-19 has affected more than 200 countries, with more than 90 million cases and almost 2 million deaths. So far, there is no quality evidence regarding the specific pharmacological therapy for COVID-19; most treatments usually involve off-label use of existing drugs and have unproven efficacy. The global effort converges on the development of a vaccine; however, the greatest challenge is to achieve collective immunization in the face of increasing vaccination hesitancy. METHODS: This study investigated the impact of vaccine hesitancy movements on the goal of COVID-19 immunization in Brazil. An integrative bibliographic review was performed with an electronic search on PubMed and SciELO that yielded 13.535 articles. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied which included 29 interventional and descriptive studies. RESULTS: The results of the 29 studies revealed that the most frequent reasons for hesitation is skepticism about the true interests of the industry and politicians, the lack of trust in research, and inaccurate information on social media. CONCLUSION: The main factors that lead the population not to believe in vaccines were the real interests of industry and politicians, lack of confidence in research, and the amount of false information that circulates massively on social media and because of that it is possible that Brazil will face some challenges in achieving collective immunity due to the anti-vaccine movement. © 2021 Editora Universitaria da PUCRS.

The novel coronavirus pandemic is a major burden on public health and healthcare professionals. The study of the prevalence of antibodies among medical workers provides an understanding of the potential risk of transmission of the infectious agent, the level of herd immunity, the introduction of specific immunization and risk stratification in various areas of professional activities. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the personnel of the medical and sanitary unit, providing the population with outpatient and inpatient medical care. Materials and methods. A study to assess seroprevalence to the SARS-CoV-2 virus was carried out in the Omsk region from September 2020 to December 2020. The study included 2 groups of employees of continuously operating organizations – the main group – employees of the medical and sanitary unit of the city of Omsk (n = 631), the control group consisted of employees of two industrial enterprises in the city of Omsk (n = 1696). The level of class G immunoglobulins to the SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. Among medical workers, the proportion of people with a positive reaction to IgG was 73.1% (n = 461; 95% CI 69.5–76.4%). In the control group, the proportion of those who were seropositive was 3.9 times less than that – 18.6% (n = 315; 95% CI 16.8–20.5). Significant differences in seroprevalence in men and women were revealed in medical workers (χ2 = 4.164; p = 0.0413). The highest proportion of seroconversion was found in nursing staff – 85,4% (95% CI 71.6 – 93.1), in doctors – 63.3% (95% CI 55.0–70.9). The highest rate of seroprevalence was found among hospital medical workers – 81.9%, the lowest among employees of the administrative and economic service – 51,8%. Conclusions. The level of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among medical workers significantly exceeded that of other professional groups, and there was a high proportion of seroconversion among junior medical personnel and in-patient medical unit workers. © Blokh AI et al.","Coronaviridae; COVID-19; Health care worker; Medical organization; Risk factors; SARS-CoV-2; Seroprevalence",""

Design A prospective observational study. Setting Public healthcare system in Santa Clara County (California, USA). Participants Women with symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and their infants were enrolled between 15 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. Outcomes SARS-CoV-2 serology analyses in the cord and maternal blood at delivery and longitudinally in infant blood between birth and 28 weeks of life. Results Of 145 mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, 86 had symptomatic infections: 78 with mild-moderate symptoms, and 8 with severe-critical symptoms. The seropositivity rates of the mothers at delivery was 65% (95% CI 0.56% to 0.73%) and the cord blood was 58% (95% CI 0.49% to 0.66%). IgG levels significantly correlated between the maternal and cord blood (Rs=0.93, p<0.0001). IgG transplacental transfer ratio was significantly higher when the first maternal positive PCR was 60-180 days before delivery compared with <60 days (1.2 vs 0.6, p<0.0001). Infant IgG seroreversion rates over follow-up periods of 1-4, 5-12, and 13-28 weeks were 8% (4 of 48), 12% (3 of 25), and 38% (5 of 13), respectively. The IgG seropositivity in the infants was positively related to IgG levels in the cord blood and persisted up to 6 months of age. Two newborns showed seroconversion at 2 weeks of age with high levels of IgM and IgG, including one premature infant with confirmed intrapartum infection. Conclusions Maternal SARS-CoV-2 IgG is efficiently transferred across the placenta when infections occur more than 2 months before delivery. Maternally derived passive immunity may persist in infants up to 6 months of life. Neonates are capable of mounting a strong antibody response to perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

This observation led us to perform epidemiological analysis, using data in the public domain, to study the correlation of COVID-19 with the prevalence and vaccination strategies for two respiratory pathogens: flu and tuberculosis (TB). Countries showing more than 1000 COVID-19 deaths were selected at three time points during the ongoing pandemic: 17 May, 1 October and 31 December 2020. The major findings of this study that are broadly consistent at all three time points are: First, countries with high flu deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Second, TB incidences and deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Countries displaying high TB and flu deaths (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Indonesia, India) display lower COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with low TB and flu deaths (Italy, Spain, USA, France). Third, countries with greater flu vaccination display lower flu incidences but higher COVID-19 deaths/million and mortality rates. On the other hand, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination negatively correlates with Covid-19 deaths/million. Fourth, countries with only BCG, but no flu, vaccination show delayed and lower number of COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with flu, but no BCG, vaccination. Fifth, countries with high BCG vaccination coverage as well as high TB deaths display the lowest COVID-19 deaths/million. The implications of this global study are discussed with respect to the roles of respiratory infections and vaccinations in lowering COVID-19 deaths. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","BCG; COVID-19; flu; tuberculosis; vaccinations","BCG Vaccine; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Tuberculosis; Vaccination; BCG vaccine; influenza vaccine; Article; BCG vaccination; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; Ethiopia; France; heterologous immunity; human; immunization; incidence; India; Indonesia; influenza; influenza vaccination; Italy; mortality; mortality rate; Myanmar; Nigeria; prevalence; questionnaire; Spain; tuberculosis; United States; vaccination; vaccination coverage; pandemic; tuberculosis; vaccination"

Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination.While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, ana-phylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactionsthat are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications.The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem fromactivation of mast cells via Fcε receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include:The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal.Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy.Allergists’ expertise in proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic reactions is vital for thescreening of high-risk individuals. © 2021 by the authors.

Several studies have been conducted on attitudes of the public towards COVID-19 vaccines and the potential influencing factors. The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the data available on the various factors influencing public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. This scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) State-ment. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central were searched without restrictions to reclaim all publications on the factors that shape individuals’ attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines from 1 January 2020 to 15 February 2021. Fifty studies were included. The scoping review revealed that the factors influencing public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines were embedded within the different levels of the socio-ecological model. These factors included the sociodemographic characteristics of the individuals, individual factors, social and organizational factors. In addition, certain characteristics of COVID-19 vaccines themselves influenced public attitudes towards accepting the vaccines. Understanding various population needs and the factors shaping public attitudes towards the vaccines would support planning for evidence-based multilevel interventions in order to enhance global vaccine uptake. © 2021 by the authors.

However, concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine are growing around the globe. The current study was conducted to investigate young the adult population’s hesitancy towards the vaccine. The study used a prospective cross-sectional design. Data was collected using an online self-administered questionnaire. A total of 862 Saudi adults participated. Information was gathered on the participants’ perspectives towards the severity and susceptibility of the COVID-19 infection, reasons for their hesitancy to receive the vaccine, perceived benefits, and reasons for action. Just under a quarter (19.6%) of respondents had previously tested positive for COVID-19. A small minority of the participants had already received the vaccine (2.1%), while 20.3% had registered in the Sehaty app (application) to receive the vaccine. Just under half of them (48%) will take the vaccine when mass vaccination is achieved and approximately the same number (46.7%) will only take it if it is made mandatory. Vaccine reluctance is highly prevalent among the general public in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many are aware of a high likelihood of getting the infection, the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccine were reported as barriers to vaccination. © 2021 by the authors.","COVID-19; Saudi arbia; Vaccination hesitancy; Vaccine reluctance","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; drug safety; drug therapy; educational status; female; health status; herd immunity; human; human experiment; hypertension; innate immunity; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; mass immunization; pandemic; prospective study; questionnaire; Saudi Arabia; vaccine hesitancy; young adult"

Several vaccines, conceived in 2020, that evoke protective spike antibody responses are being deployed in mass public health vaccination programs. Recent data suggests, however, that as sequence variation in the spike genome accumulates, some vaccines may lose efficacy. Methods: Using a macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the efficacy of a peptide-based vaccine targeting MHC class I epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. We administered biodegradable microspheres with synthetic peptides and adjuvants to rhesus macaques. Unvaccinated control and vaccinated macaques were challenged with 1 × 108 TCID50 units of SARS-CoV-2, followed by assessment of clinical symptoms and viral load, chest radiographs, and sampling of peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for downstream analysis. Results: Vaccinated animals were free of pneumonia-like infiltrates characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and presented with lower viral loads relative to controls. Gene expression in cells collected from BAL samples of vaccinated macaques revealed a unique signature associated with enhanced development of adaptive immune responses relative to control macaques. Conclusions: We demonstrate that a room temperature stable peptide vaccine based on known immunogenic HLA class I bound CTL epitopes from the nucleocapsid protein can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates. © 2021 by the authors.

Some have argued that immunity passports are unethical and impractical, pointing to uncertainties relating to COVID-19 immunity, issues with testing, perverse incentives, doubtful economic benefits, privacy concerns, and the risk of discriminatory effects. We first review the scientific feasibility of immunity passports. Considerable hurdles remain, but increasing understanding of the neutralising antibody response to COVID-19 might make identifying members of the community at low risk of contracting and transmitting COVID-19 possible. We respond to the ethical arguments against immunity passports and give the positive ethical arguments. First, a strong presumption should be in favour of preserving people's free movement if at all feasible. Second, failing to recognise the reduced infection threat immune individuals pose risks punishing people for low-risk behaviour.

Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and findings We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and-importantly-some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%-80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. Conclusions With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management. © 2021 Adil Mahmoud Yousif et al.

Combining these modules, a SEI3RSD model will be developed, which can take into account a possible passive immunisation by vaccination as well as different durations of latent and incubation periods. Besides, infectious persons with and without symptoms can be distinguished. Due to the current world-wide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19 pandemic) models for description of the spread of infectious diseases and their application for forecasts have become into the focus of the scientific community as well as of broad public more than usual. Currently, many papers and studies have appeared and appear dealing with the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease caused by it. This occurs under medical, virological, economic, sociological and further aspects as well as under mathematical points of view. Concerning the last-mentioned point, the main focus lies on the application of existing models and their adaptation to data about the course of infection available at the current time. Clearly, the aim is to predict the possible further development, for instance in Germany. It is of particular interest to investigate how will be the influence of political and administrative measures like contact restrictions, closing or rather re-opening of schools, restaurants, hotels etc. on the course of infection. The steps considered here for building up suitable models are well-known for long time. However, understandably they will not be dealt with in an extended way in current application-oriented works. Therefore, it is the aim of this study to present some existing steps of modelling without any pretension of completeness. Thus, on the one hand we give assistance and, on the other hand, we develop a model capable to take already known properties of COVID-19 as well as a later possible passive immunisation by vaccination and a possible loss of immunity of recovered persons into account. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","epidemiologic models; mathematical modelling; qualitative solution behaviour; SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Curricula; Immunization; Vaccines; Viruses; Administrative measures; Application-oriented; Incubation periods; Infectious disease; Scientific community; Diseases"

Whether SARS-CoV-2 is augmented by ADE remains undetermined and has therefore garnered criticism for the improper attribution of the phenomenon to the pandemic.

Different preventive efforts have been undertaken in response to this global health predicament; amongst them, vaccine development is at the forefront. Several sophisticated designs have been applied to create a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and 44 candidates have already entered clinical trials. At present, it is unclear which ones will meet the objectives of efficiency and safety, though several vaccines are gearing up to obtain emergency approval in the U.S. and Europe. This manuscript discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various vaccine platforms and evaluates the safety and efficacy of vaccines in advance stages. Once a vaccine is developed, the next challenge will be acquisition, deployment, and uptake. The present manuscript describes these challenges in detail and proposes solutions to the vast array of translational challenges. It is evident from the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 that the virus will remain a threat to everybody as long as the virus is still circulating in a few.

With limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2, current attempts at controlling its spread are focused on the suppressing approach (to reduce a sustained endogenous transmission) and the mitigating approach (to reduce the growth rate of the epidemic). On the one hand, while there has been no firm explanation, many governments have considered immunity passport and herd immunity for paths out of restrictive physical distancing measures imposed to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but were not successful. Purpose of Review: Herein, we attempted to systematize the lessons and shreds of evidence related to the spectrum of illness, the physiological mechanisms of host suscept-ibility, herd immunity, immunity passport, gender disparities, and severe challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that the insights provided in this review will help raise the effectiveness of the treatment policies and preventive measures required to end the pandemic. Recent Findings: The use of immunity passports is suggested to certify an individual at low risk of acquiring or transmitting SARS-CoV-2. But, an individual might nevertheless carry the virus at similar levels and for a similar duration to those previously uninfected, with an unchanged potential for transmission. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a complex issue inherent to a vaccine and the population receiving the vaccine. The central epidemiological questions about are as follows: what proportion of the population should be vaccinated to meet elimination (in a local program), eradication (in a global program) or a defined level of control? How is this affected by demographic factors (such as gender)? What is the best age at which to immunize? Besides, although age-dependent mortality risk is estimated to be higher for men and older people, such interpretation across gender, age groups, and coun-tries, however, must be accepted with caution at present. Summary: COVID-19 has taught us that health is the basis of global wealth and interna-tional solidarity is an essential response and a superior approach to isolationism. Hence, we must be clear about what the alternatives are when evaluating the merits of different ways of tackling this pandemic both in the short term as well as in the long term. © 2020 Sisay and Tolessa.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Gender disparity; Herd immunity; Immunity passport; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; demography; diagnostic procedure; disease severity; dyspnea; fever; herd immunity; host susceptibility; human; hypoxemia; immunization; incubation time; lifestyle; morbidity; mortality; nausea; pandemic; public health; Review; sex difference; social distancing; vomiting"

Currently, several vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are in clinical trials but approval of these vaccines is likely to take a long time before they are available for public use. In a previous report, the importance of passive immunity and how immunoglobulin (Ig)G collected from recovered coronavirus patients could help in the protection against COVID-19 and boost the immune system of new patients was reported. Passive immunity by immunoglobulin transfer is a concept employed by most mammals and bovine IgG has a role to play in human therapy. IgG is one of the major components of the immunological activity found in cow's milk and colostrum. Heterologous transfer of passive immunity associated with the consumption of bovine immune milk by humans has been investigated for decades for its immunological activity against infections. This short review focuses on passive immunity and how microfiltered raw immune milk or colostrum collected from cows vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 could provide short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and could be used as an option until a vaccine becomes commercially available. © Copyright © 2020 Jawhara.","colostrum; coronavirus; COVID-19; IgG; immune milk; immunoglobulin; SARS-CoV-2","Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Cattle; Colostrum; Coronavirus Infections; Drinking; Female; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunoglobulin G; Milk; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Viral Vaccines; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; gamma interferon; hyperimmune globulin; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G1 antibody; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 6; polyclonal antibody; sab 301; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; tumor necrosis factor; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; virus vaccine; Campylobacter; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical outcome; colostrum; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; cow milk; critically ill patient; Cryptosporidium; disease severity; human; immunization; inflammation; liver injury; lymphocyte count; microfiltration; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; passive immunization; raw milk; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; short course therapy; virus load; virus neutralization; animal; Betacoronavirus; bovine; Coronavirus infection; drinking; female; immunology; milk; pandemic; procedures; vaccination; virology; virus pneumonia"

The development of COVID-19 vaccine has a potential to induce long-lasting cellular and humoral immunity and ending this pandemic. Currently, there are 213 vaccines in development, with 66 in clinical trials and 9 in phase III. In one hand the vaccines are developed using novel vaccine platforms including DNA and mRNA based, antigen-presenting cell, viral vector, protein or peptide-based, inactivated virus, and live attenuated virus platform. Each of these platforms has its own strength and weakness; however, they generally enable the vaccine to be developed safely, more quickly, and easier to upscale. In the other hand, the demand for COVID-19 vaccine has led to the development of vaccine being fast-tracked. Concerns are being raised for the efficacy, safety, equitability, and acceptance of these vaccines. Many are worried about the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement that may worsen the recipient’s condition. Vaccine design therefore should take into account previous experience with vaccine-associated disease enhancement. Researchers should adhere to stringent standards of safety and efficacy when conducting vaccine’s clinical trials. Accelerated trials should also adhere to the Declaration of Helsinki for the ethics of medical research. Global partnership for vaccine development and equitable distribution is also needed to prevent resurgences of cases. Finally, there is a need to combat misinformation and distrust of COVID-19 vaccine in the eye of the general public. © 2020, Yerevan State Medical University.

Progress in biomedical science and technology has expanded the public health arsenal against infectious diseases. Specifically, vaccination has reduced the burden of infectious pathogens. Engineering systemic immunity by harnessing the cutaneous immune network has been particularly attractive since the skin is an easily accessible immune-responsive organ. Recent advances in skin-targeted drug delivery strategies have enabled safe, patient-friendly, and controlled deployment of vaccines to cutaneous microenvironments for inducing long-lived pathogen-specific immunity to mitigate infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Areas covered: This review briefly discusses the basics of cutaneous immunomodulation and provides a concise overview of emerging skin-targeted drug delivery systems that enable safe, minimally invasive, and effective intracutaneous administration of vaccines for engineering systemic immune responses to combat infectious diseases. Expert opinion: In-situ engineering of the cutaneous microenvironment using emerging skin-targeted vaccine delivery systems offers remarkable potential to develop diverse immunization strategies against pathogens. Mechanistic studies with standard correlates of vaccine efficacy will be important to compare innovative intracutaneous drug delivery strategies to each other and to existing clinical approaches. Cost-benefit analyses will be necessary for developing effective commercialization strategies. Significant involvement of industry and/or government will be imperative for successfully bringing novel skin-targeted vaccine delivery methods to market for their widespread use. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biomaterials science; COVID-19; Cutaneous immunomodulation; Emerging infectious diseases; Engineering immunity; Skin-targeted drug delivery; Vaccination","Adjuvants, Immunologic; Administration, Cutaneous; Animals; Antigens; Biocompatible Materials; Cellular Microenvironment; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Nanoparticles; SARS-CoV-2; Skin; Vaccination; Vaccines; nanoparticle; nucleic acid; vaccine; antigen; biomaterial; immunological adjuvant; nanoparticle; Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine; vaccine; communicable disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cost benefit analysis; drug delivery system; engineering; human; immunity; immunization; immunomodulation; infection; medical decision making; minimally invasive procedure; nonhuman; Review; skin; administration and dosage; animal; chemistry; communicable disease control; cutaneous drug administration; drug delivery system; immunology; metabolism; prevention and control; procedures; skin; tumor microenvironment; vaccination"

Traditional public health vaccine introduction planning will need to be both accelerated and more comprehensive to ensure optimal uptake across the country.

This narrative review provides an inclusive view of scientific hypotheses, logical derivation, and early analyses that substantiate or refute such conjectures. At the completion of a relatively less restrictive search of this evolving topic, 13 articles—all published in 2020, were included in this early narrative review. Directional themes arising from the identified literature imply the potential relationship between childhood vaccination and COVID-19—either based on the potential genomic and immunological protective effects of heterologous immunity, or based on observational associations of cross-immunity among vaccines and other prior endemic diseases. Our review suggests that immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in children is different than in adults, resulting in differences in the levels of severity of symptoms and outcomes of the disease in different age groups. Further clinical investigations are warranted of at least three childhood vaccines: BCG, MMR, and HEP-A for their potential protective role against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. © Copyright © 2020 Beric-Stojsic, Kalabalik-Hoganson, Rizzolo and Roy.","children; COVID-19; immunization; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines",""

Increased measles incidence rates and considerable disease burden have been observed in under-vaccinated communities, predominantly Jewish ultraorthodox. The measles epidemic, despite proper public health handling, revealed susceptible population subgroups as well as gaps and lacking resources in the Israeli public health systems. In the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as of December 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reported nationally was over 300,000 with approximately 3000 fatalities. Notably, minority groups such as the ultraorthodox Jewish community and the Arab community in Israel has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe it is still possible to implement the key lessons from the measles outbreak in Israel that could aid in the COVID-19 response in Israel and elsewhere. These conceptions should include a social-based approach, investment in public health human resources and infrastructure, tackling root causes of inequalities, emphasis on trust and solidarity, proactive communication, need for political will, and proper use of epidemiological data as a basis for decision-making.

Scientists have screened neutralizing antibodies using the virus receptor-binding domain (RBD) as an antigen, indicating that RBD contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, which are the main structural domains for inducing neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immune responses. This review summarizes the structure and function of RBD and RBD-specific NMAbs against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 currently under development. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Epitopes; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Receptors, Virus; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Virion; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epitope; immunoglobulin G; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; virus RNA; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; protein binding; virus antibody; virus receptor; binding assay; binding site; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; crystal structure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; epitope mapping; follow up; gene mutation; gene sequence; human; IC50; ID50; immunization; mortality rate; nonhuman; receptor binding; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load; virus neutralization; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; biosynthesis; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; cross reaction; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; molecular model; pandemic; pathogenicity; protein secondary structure; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; ultrastructure; virion; virology; virus pneumonia"

Up to now, effective antiviral treatment against COVID-19 is not available. Therefore, throughout virus infections, a thorough clarification of the virus-host immune system interactions will be most probably helpful to encounter these challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 primarily suppresses the innate immune system, enabling its stable propagation during the early stage of infection. Consequently, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been increasing during infection progression associated with severe lung pathology. It is imperative to consider hyper inflammation in vaccine designing, as vaccine-induced immune responses must have a protective role against infection without leading to immunopathology. Among the front-line responders to viral infections, Natural Killer (NK) cells have immense therapeutic potential, forming a bridge between innate and adaptive responses. A subset of NK cells exhibits putatively increased effector functions against viruses following pathogen-specific and immunization. Memory NK cells have higher cytotoxicity and effector activity, compared with the conventional NK cells. As a pioneering strategy, prompt accumulation and long‐term maintenance of these memory NK cells could be an efficacious viral treatment. According to the high prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in the world, it remains to be determined whether HCMV adaptive NK cells could play a protective role against this new emerging virus. In addition, the new adaptive-like KIR+NKG2C+ NK cell subset (the adaptive-like lung tissue residue [tr]NK cell) in the context of the respiratory infection at this site could specifically exhibit the expansion upon COVID-19. Another aspect of NK cells we should note, utilizing modified NK cells such as allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells as a state-of-the-art strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. In this line, we speculate introducing NKG2C into chimeric antigen receptors in NK cells might be a potential approach in future viral immunotherapy for emerging viruses. In this contribution, we will briefly discuss the current status and future perspective of NK cells, which provide to successfully exploit NK cell-mediated antiviral activity that may offer important new tools in COVID-19 treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Soleimanian and Yaghobi.","adaptive NK cell; immune system; inflammatory cytokine; memory NK cell; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; chimeric antigen receptor; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; interferon; nicotinamide; nicotinic acid; tocilizumab; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor; adaptive immunity; allogenic cell; antiviral activity; cell function; cell therapy; clinical effectiveness; coronavirus disease 2019; cytomegalovirus infection; cytotoxicity; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; drug mechanism; human; Human cytomegalovirus; immune response; immunoassay; immunological memory; immunological procedures; immunopathogenesis; immunotherapy; innate immunity; memory cell; natural killer cell; nonhuman; patient care; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction"

Using a panel of 37 convalescent COVID-19 human serum samples, we showed that the magnitude and specificity of responses varied across individuals, independent of their reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs). These data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will elicit primary humoral immune responses in naïve individuals and variable responses in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the limited cross-coronavirus reactivities in humans, serum samples from 96 dogs and 10 cats showed SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific responses focused on non–S1 proteins. The correlation of this response with those to other coronaviruses suggests that the antibodies are cross-reactive and generated to endemic viruses within these hosts, which must be considered in seroepidemiologic studies. We conclude that substantial variation in antibody generation against coronavirus proteins will influence interpretations of serologic data in the clinical and veterinary settings. © 2020 by the authors.

Highly pathogenic H7N9 cases with severe disease were reported recently, indicating the continuing public health threat and the need for a prophylactic vaccine. Here we review the development of recombinant influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) as vaccines against H7N9 virus. Several approaches to vaccine development are reviewed including the expression of VLPs in mammalian, plant and insect cell expression systems. Although considerable progress has been achieved, including demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs in the human clinical trials, the remaining challenges need to be addressed.

The basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects and, eventually, many vaccine recipients. This is further complicated by economic and political pressures to reduce government oversight on rushed vaccine testing and production, nationalistic distribution goals, and failure to plan for the widespread immunization needed to produce global herd immunity.

This finding has posed many questions about the vulnerability factors of ethnic minority members to COVID-19 and many unconfirmed views are in circulation. Environmental factors appear to be the chief orchestrator of this anomaly. The recent findings about the durability of COVID-19 antibodies in the infected people has put some concerns about the prospects of long-term immunisation methods. Safe immunisation, effective medications to block the cytokine storm responsible for the complications of COVID-19 are sure ways of combatting the current pandemic, but these might take some time to come into realty. So, another option to deal with the toxic pathogen is optimising our immunity which in itself is another dimension of surviving the pandemic. It seems to be a neglected or forgotten aspect of combatting the pandemic. There ought to be more public and political awareness of harmonizing immunity. Adherents of integrated medicine seem to have more awareness of different facets of immunity and they go beyond the conventional methods. According to the principles of integrated medicine, there may also be an extra-physiological immunity that can be brought into action in times of physiological crisis. © 2020, JMN Medical Education Ltd.

However, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. Survey results on uptake intentions vary and continue to change. This review compared trends and synthesized findings in vaccination receptivity over time across US and international polls, assessing survey design influences and evaluating context to inform policies and practices. Data sources included academic literature (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO following PRISMA guidelines), news and official reports published by 20 October 2020. Two researchers independently screened potential peer‐reviewed articles and syndicated polls for eligibility; 126 studies and surveys were selected. Declining vaccine acceptance (from >70% in March to <50% in October) with demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan divides was observed. Perceived risk, concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness, doctors’ recommendations, and inoculation history were common factors. Impacts of regional infection rates, gender, and personal COVID‐19 experience were inconclusive. Unique COVID‐19 factors included political party orien-tation, doubts toward expedited development/approval process, and perceived political interfer-ence. Many receptive participants preferred to wait until others have taken the vaccine; mandates could increase resistance. Survey wording and answer options showed influence on responses. To achieve herd immunity, communication campaigns are immediately needed, focusing on transpar-ency and restoring trust in health authorities. © 2020 by the authors.

Among the various treatment proposals for COVID-19 infection, passive immunotherapy using plasma from recovering patients - “convalescent plasma” (CP)- could be a promising option in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Immune (i.e. “convalescent”) plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of plasma therapy is permitted when faced with «serious diseases for which there are no effective pharmacological treatments». Several clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness of hyperimmune plasma at various stages of SARS-CoV2.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. regulatory authority, has approved the use of CP for compassionate use in the treatment of patients with a critical COVID-19 infection. Below are the general indications for drawing up clinical protocols for the integral management of “COVID-19-convalescent plasma” for which the validation and approval of the Ethics Committees is still necessary. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Covid -19; Hyperimmune plasma; Passive immunotherapy","COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Immunization, Passive; SARS-CoV-2; Workflow; SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma; clinical protocol; comparative effectiveness; compassionate use; coronavirus disease 2019; drawing; Food and Drug Administration; human; immunity; immunotherapy; professional standard; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; workflow; World Health Organization; epidemic; epidemiology; immunology; passive immunization; physiology; therapy"

This is a problem that many individuals and agencies are working hard to address globally. As clinicians and biomedical scientists we often focus on the health benefits that vaccines provide, in the prevention of ill-health and death from infectious pathogens. Here we discuss the health, economic and social benefits of vaccines that have been identified and studied in recent years, impacting all regions and all age groups. After learning of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in December 2019, and its potential for global dissemination to cause COVID-19 disease was realized, there was an urgent need to develop vaccines at an unprecedented rate and scale.

Several innovative approaches are in development to restrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, BCG, a vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), is being considered as an alternative therapeutic modality. BCG vaccine is known to induce both humoral and adaptive immunities, thereby activating both nonspecific and cross-reactive immune responses in the host, which combined could effectively resist other pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. Notably, some studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, case positivity, and mortality rate have been higher in countries that have not adopted BCG vaccination than in countries that have done so. This review presents an overview of the concepts underlying BCG vaccination and its nonspecific immuological effects and protection, resulting in ‘trained immunity’ and potential utility for resisting COVID-19. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","bcg vaccine; COVID-19; cross-reactivity; immune response; sars-CoV-2; trained immunity; tuberculosis","Adaptive Immunity; BCG Vaccine; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross Reactions; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Tuberculosis; BCG vaccine; BCG vaccine; alternative medicine; Article; cell differentiation; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; disease control; epigenetics; hope; human; immune response; immunization; immunotherapy; macrophage; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; public health; questionnaire; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tuberculosis; vaccination; adaptive immunity; cross reaction; drug effect; drug repositioning; drug therapy; immunology; pandemic; pharmacology; prevention and control; procedures; tuberculosis"

Consumer confidence, product quality and safety, types of products, and the emergence and re-emergence of diseases will continue to be major challenges to the current situation and the strategic future of the industry. Foodborne and zoonotic diseases are strictly linked with poultry. Eradication, elimination, and/or control of foodborne and zoonotic pathogens present a major challenge to the poultry industry. In addition, the public health hazards from consuming foods with high antibiotic residues will remain a critical issue. The theory of poultry production described in this review will not be limited to considering disease control. Rather, it will also incorporate the interconnection of the animals' health, welfare, and immunity. It is essential to know that chickens are not susceptible to intranasal infection by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic will affect poultry consumption, transport, and the economics of poultry farming. It will also take into consideration economic, ethical, social dimensions, and the sustenance of the accomplishment of high environmental security. Stockholders, veterinarians, farmers, and all the partners of the chain of poultry production need to be more involved in the current situation and the strategic future of the industry to fulfill human demands and ensure sustainable agriculture. Thus, the present review explores these important tasks. © Copyright © 2020 Hafez and Attia.","biosecurity; consumer protection; COVID-19; Disease control; food safety; poultry disease; SARS-CoV-2","amino acid; antibiotic agent; fat; fatty acid; food additive; mineral; protein; vaccine; vitamin; animal food; animal welfare; antibiotic resistance; bird disease; consumer attitude; coronavirus disease 2019; diet therapy; disease control; disease re-emergence; education program; epidemic; food safety; futurology; genetic resistance; human; immune system; immunity; immunization; nonhuman; pandemic; politics; poultry; poultry farming; poultry product; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social status; vaccination; vaccine break"

Why did these recognized healthcare systems fail to face the pandemic and why other systems could do it? This should be studied and known well to be used for future planning of healthcare strategies in case this pandemic to reactivated or any other pandemic to reveal at any time. Mitigation strategies are very important to limit the spread of the pandemic. So, the aim of this study is to review and analyse the mitigation strategies that have been practiced during previous pandemics. This research reviewed the strategy of social distancing, global containment measures, herd immunity and mass testing. It was concluded that, although social distancing is very important in decreasing the spread of epidemic, having specific vaccination is paramount. Meanwhile, it should be remembered that in the absence of proper vaccination, ‘herd immunity’ is the most effective policy to counteract the spread of the disease in the community. On the other hand, herd immunity is a challenging strategy that must be strictly controlled otherwise would be disastrous. In all cases transparency and trust should be built with the public to preserve calmness and compliance to the mitigation measures. © 2020, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

It has sternly affected public health, economy, education, and social behavior around the world. Several scientific and medical communities have mounted concerted efforts to limit this pandemic and the subsequent wave of viral spread by developing preventative and potential vaccines. So far, no medicine or vaccine has been approved to prevent or treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review describes the latest advances in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans, mainly focusing on the lead candidates in clinical trials. Moreover, we seek to provide both the advantages and the disadvantages of the leading platforms used in current vaccine development, based on past vaccine delivery efforts for non-SARS CoV-2 infections.

In this article we describe lessons learned from past pandemics and vaccine campaigns about the path to successful vaccine delivery. The historical record suggests that to have a widely immunized population, leaders must invest in evidence-based vaccine delivery strategies that generate demand, allocate and distribute vaccines, and verify coverage. To generate demand, there must be an understanding of the roots of vaccine hesitancy, involvement of trusted sources of authority in advocacy for vaccination, and commitment to longitudinal engagement with communities. To allocate vaccines, qualified organizations and expert coalitions must be allowed to determine evidence-based vaccination approaches and generate the political will to ensure the cooperation of local and national governments. To distribute vaccines, the people and organizations with expertise in manufacturing, supply chains, and last-mile distribution must be positioned to direct efforts. To verify vaccine coverage, vaccination tracking systems that are portable, interoperable, and secure must be identified. Lessons of past pandemics suggest that nations should invest in evidence-informed strategies to ensure that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines protect individuals, suppress transmission, and minimize disruption to health services and livelihoods. ©2021 Project HOPE— The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.","","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Immunization Programs; Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; authority; clinical trial protocol; community care; consumer advocacy; cooperation; coronavirus disease 2019; drug distribution; drug industry; evidence based practice; health care delivery; health care personnel; health service; human; immune response; investment; leadership; pandemic; political system; population; privacy; public health campaign; resource allocation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trust; United States; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; administration and dosage; health care delivery; organization and management; prevention and control; preventive health service; vaccination"

Novel and improved preventative strategies with the potential to benefit pregnant women and their infants are needed, with maternal and neonatal immunization representing effective approaches. Experts from immunology, vaccinology, infectious diseases, clinicians, industry, public health, and vaccine-related social sciences convened at the 5th International Neonatal and Maternal Immunization Symposium (INMIS) in Vancouver, Canada, from 15 to 17 September 2019. We critically evaluated the lessons learned from recent clinical studies, presented cutting-edge scientific progress in maternal and neonatal immunology and vaccine development, and discussed maternal and neonatal immunization in the broader context of infectious disease epidemiology and public health. Focusing on practical aspects of research and implementation, we also discussed the safety, awareness, and perception of maternal immunization as an existing strategy to address the need to improve maternal and neonatal health worldwide. The symposium provided a comprehensive scientific and practical primer as well as an update for all those with an interest in maternal and neonatal infection, immunity, and vaccination.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are lethal species caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Currently, a novel strain of HCoVs, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province of China, and has since spread worldwide causing an outbreak in more than 200 countries. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 and a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in late January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract causing flu-like symptoms and, in some, may cause severe illness like pneumonia and multi-organ failure leading to death. Today, Covid-19 cases almost reaching 9 million, with more than 450 thousand deaths. There is an urgent demand for developing a vaccine since no effective therapies or vaccines have been approved to this day to prevent or minimize the spread of the infection.

For this reason, a case-control study aiming to test this hypothesis has been initiated in Quebec. Several phase III clinical trials are underway, including one in Canada, to assess the efficacy of BCG against SARS-CoV-2 infection (results expected in 2021). In the past, BCG has been widely used in Canada but current indications are restricted to high-risk individuals and communities experiencing TB outbreaks as well as for the treatment of bladder cancer. The potential implication of BCG as an interim measure to mitigate COVID-19 is the subject of widespread discussion in the scientific community and can be considered for the vulnerable population in Canada. To conclude, BCG vaccination should be placed on the agenda of research funding agencies, scientific advisory committees on immunization and federal/provincial/territorial public health authorities. © 2020, The Canadian Public Health Association.","BCG; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Innate immunity; SARS-CoV-2; Trained immunity","BCG Vaccine; Canada; Case-Control Studies; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; COVID-19; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Pandemics; BCG vaccine; Canada; case control study; human; innate immunity; pandemic; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); prevention and control"

Controls can have well-known counterintuitive effects on endemic infections, including the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected, but also large outbreaks during control resulting from accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are poorly understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without control, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, counting from the time that control started, than without any control–the divorce effect. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in a variety of models when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches, and in the context of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at COVID-19. © 2020 Hollingsworth et al.

In this paper, we describe a vision for the next generation of digital immunization information systems for upper-middle and high-income settings based on our experience in Canada. These systems center on the premise that the public is engaged and informed about the immunization process beyond their interaction with primary care, and that they will be a contributor and auditor of immunization data. The digital immunization system of the future will facilitate reporting of adverse events following immunization, issue digital immunization receipts, permit identification of areas of need and allow for delivery of interventions targeting these areas. Through features like immunization reminders and targeted immunization promotion campaigns, the system will reduce many of the known barriers that influence immunization rates. In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, adaptive digital public health information systems will be required to guide the rollout and post-market surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. © The Author(s), 2020.","health information systems; health technology; immunization; public health practice","algorithm; bioremediation; coronavirus disease 2019; electronic health record; government; health care delivery; health care personnel; herd immunity; high income country; hospitalization; human; immune response; immunization; information system; machine learning; medical information system; middle income country; pandemic; post exposure prophylaxis; postmarketing surveillance; prevalence; public health; Review; thematic analysis; vaccination; virus detection"

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread.

The pandemic is affecting the livelihood of millions of people all over the world. At the time of preparing this report, the pandemic has affected 1 827 284 patients, with 113 031 deaths in 185 countries as per Johns Hopkins University. With no proven treatment for the disease, prevention of the disease in the community and healthcare setting is need of the hour. Objective: To perform a comprehensive literature search for preventive measures and experimental treatment options. In this review, we have focused our discussion on the risk of disease transmission, supportive treatment, and possible treatment options based on available evidence. Evidence Review: We performed a literature search on google scholar, PubMed, and society guidelines for literature related to COVID 19 and previous coronavirus pandemics. We included data review articles, observational studies, and controlled trials to synthesize the treatment options for COVID 19. Findings: In this article, we have extensively reviewed and discussed recommendations from various world organizations for the public and healthcare workers. We have also discussed currently available experimental treatments since there is no proven treatment for COVID 19. The best method of dealing with the current outbreak is to reduce the community spread and thus “flatten the curve.” Although Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Azithromycin have been tried, passive immunity through convalescent serum and vaccine is still at an experimental stage. Patients with severe COVID 19 infections could be considered for this experimental treatment through various national randomized control trials, which may eventually lead to an evidence-based treatment strategy. Conclusions and Relevance: Awareness of currently available experimental treatment among healthcare providers and exploration of possible treatment options through evidence is need of the hour. We have discussed the most recently available literature and evidence behind experimental treatment in this article. © The Author(s) 2020.","coronavirus; COVID-19; pandemic; Remdesivir; RT-PCR; Wuhan","antihypertensive agent; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; azithromycin; chloroquine; corticosteroid; darunavir; emetine; homorringtonine; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxychloroquine sulfate; immunomodulating agent; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; ritonavir; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; unclassified drug; assisted ventilation; case fatality rate; cleaning; coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; health care; human; infection prevention; nonhuman; pandemic; passive immunization; prognosis; Review; SARS coronavirus; virus transmission"

We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose-binding lectin). If SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high-affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low-moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19 facilitates re-inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway’s mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies (""viral auto-inhalation"" phenomenon). This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient. This “quantitative and time-/sequence-dependent” model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages. © 2020 The Authors.

Nevertheless, the global burden of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Acute respiratory tract infections, for example, were responsible for approximately 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune system is well-established. A wealth of mechanistic and clinical data show that vitamins, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid play important and complementary roles in supporting the immune system. Inadequate intake and status of these nutrients are widespread, leading to a decrease in resistance to infections and as a consequence an increase in disease burden. Against this background the following conclusions are made: (1) supplementation with the above micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy to help support optimal immune function; (2) supplementation above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), but within recommended upper safety limits, for specific nutrients such as vitamins C and D is warranted; and (3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutritional strategies in their recommendations to improve public health. © 2020 by the authors.

Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation. © 2020 The Authors.
